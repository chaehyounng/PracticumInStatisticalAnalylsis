Both brands saw stellar results in the first half of 2024 and with some huge industry incentives, it's no surprise why some buyers are flocking to the South Korean marques. So can they keep up that momentum in the second half of this year?\\n\\nWelcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Hyundai's word of warning regarding sales in the second half of the year, its battle with one dealer group that is claiming inflated sales figures, as well as Honda and Sony's plan to share an EV platform. Let's jump in.\\n\\n30%: Hyundai Warns Of Strong Competition In Second Half Of 2024\\n\\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Review\\n\\nHyundai and Kia both had a fantastic first half of 2024. Between cash on the hood and insane lease deals, your wallet would practically scream at you if you were considering buying anything else.\\n\\nThat being said, Hyundai knows that it's going to have to put in the work to remain on top during the remainder of the year as competition in the EV market begins to really heat up.\\n\\nIn an interview with Automotive News Hyundai CEO Randy Parker spoke about the Korean automaker's outlook on the year, and who it really sees as its big competition moving forward:\\n\\nWe feel pretty bullish about the second half, but it's going to be tough. We've seen a lot of price cuts by our key competitors. Tesla, Ford and Nissan have cut prices this year, and we still have to deal with the consumer fears: affordability, range anxiety and charging infrastructure.\\n\\nPrice is important, sure. So is consumer education. But one thing that Parker didn't exactly touch on is how Hyundai will defend against new products coming to market in the second half of the year, as well as how it plans to stack up against vehicles already launched with improving production numbers. The Hyundai Ioniq 9 may help, but that's a ways off here.\\n\\nS&P Global Mobility analyst Stephanie Brinley says that Hyundai's best chance at a solid defense is also its greatest offense: a strong EV offering.\\n\\nThe automaker has positioned itself as a leader in the EV space, presenting the market with unique EVs that have really caught the public eye\\u2014including that of The Grand Tour and former Top Gear host, Jeremy Clarkson. Now, once it gets its Georgia \\\"Metaplant\\\" online, its vehicles should qualify for the EV tax credit. And if that happens, there's no telling how much market space the automaker can gobble up.\\n\\n60%: Dealer Group Prepares To Go To War With Hyundai Over Claims Of Inflated EV Sales\\n\\nHyundai Dealership\\n\\nAs mentioned above, Hyundai's numbers look great on paper. That's great news for EV adopters and Hyundai's shareholders, especially since the company's stock is up more than 54% this year. However, one group of dealerships has filed suit against Hyundai claiming that its sales figures may be padded.\\n\\nReuters says that the lawsuit claims that Hyundai has a secret and \\\"illegal\\\" program that helps it artificially inflate its sales figures by giving a competitive edge to dealerships who get on board with the program.\\n\\nAccording to the complaint, so-called \\\"punching dealers\\\" are encouraged to convert (\\\"punch\\\") some of its new car inventory into loaner cars through Hyundai's Service Rental Car (SCR) program. Depending on how a dealer codes SRC vehicles, the status change could trigger metrics that count towards a performance program that provides discounts on wholesale vehicles to dealers that meet certain sales objectives.\\n\\nSlow-selling vehicles can be put into this program to make it appear as if they were sold, improving sales performance optics, only to be taken out at a later time after never being used as a loaner car. This has led to some dealers improperly coding SCR vehicles into Hyundai's SCR \\\"slush fund.\\\"\\n\\nFrom the complaint:\\n\\nPunching Dealers not only have artificially lower PEP objectives, they also receive better allocation with which to meet those lower objectives and benefit from the PEP price discounts to increase sales. The result is that Punching Dealers are able to more easily obtain the PEP price discounts due to [Hyundai's] punching scheme. Siphoning off Hyundai\\u2019s best-selling models to Punching Dealers not only makes it easier for them to obtain bonus money through PEP, it also leaves innocent dealers with a model mix of vehicles which are less likely to sell, leaving them to compete for bonus money on an unlevel playing field.\\n\\nOne of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit said that when they failed to \\\"play ball,\\\" they were punished by only receiving allocations of slow-selling vehicles. The suit also claims that those not on board would be denied wholesale pricing discounts, allocations, and retain price discounts. The lawsuit claims this ultimately caused harm to the affected dealerships and the public buying the cars from them.\\n\\nThe scheme is said to have been promoted by Hyundai's middle management. In a call transcript attached to the suit, a District Sales Manager allegedly said he was \\\"tasked\\\" with getting dealers to increase the number of vehicles in the SRC program because he was \\\"up against a number.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Desperate times call for desperate measures,\\\" said the district sales manager, according to the lawsuit. He later continued: \\\"We gotta hit a number for the press and for the Koreans.\\\"\\n\\n90%: Honda's 0 EVs to Share Platform With Sony's Afeela Brand\\n\\n2024 Sony Honda Mobility Afeela prototype\\n\\nIt's no secret that Honda and Sony are working very closely together to make the consumer electronics giant's dreams come true with the Afeela EV brand. Some technology sharing is expected, as is the potential sharing of foundational underpinnings. A new report by Nikkei claims to reveal exactly which platform will be shared by the brands.\\n\\nThat feels like the obvious plan of action, but until now, both brands were mum on what EV platform the Sony project would use.\\n\\nAccording to the report, Afeela vehicles will share the underlying platform with Honda's upcoming line of futuristic-looking EVs, dubbed Honda 0. The sharing of such a low-level structure and its associated components will help both brands cut down on costs, making them both relevant and affordable in a market where cost is currently the key to driving adoption.\\n\\nFrom Nikkei:\\n\\nHonda Motor and Sony Group will use a common platform to manufacture electric vehicles, as the Japanese partners look to reduce the cost of development. The common platform will be found in Honda's 0 Series EVs, as well as electric vehicles to be sold under Afeela, a brand controlled by the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility. The EVs first will be released in North America in 2026. Honda and Sony are prioritizing lower costs and shorter development times in response to the emerging cost competitiveness among Chinese EV manufacturers. Even longtime global leader Tesla is experiencing slower sales in the current environment.\\n\\nNikkei expects that Honda will price mass-market models of the 0 series EVs around $40,000. Prior reports have pegged Afeela with a starting price of around $45,000, though later reports from Nikkei suggested pricing of around 10 million yen, or north of $62,000 USD. Afeela is designated as a high-end brand, though it's expected to use the same platform as the mass-market vehicles in Honda's 0 series. Sony says that Afeela will set itself apart by offering unique in-vehicle experiences, like the ability to remotely connect to the owner's PlayStation.\\n\\nAfeela is slated to launch its first car in 2026 with a sedan based on its Vision concept. Shortly after, it anticipates including an SUV and a second sedan.\\n\\n100%: Would You Buy An EV Branded By An Electronics Giant?\\n\\nXiaomi SU7\\n\\nPeople jokingly call EVs appliances, but when we see off-the-shelf electronic makers like Sony and Xiaomi dip their toes into the EV waters, it's entirely possible that others will do the same.\\n\\nNow, sure, building a car isn't easy. After all, Apple called it quits and we've seen just how hard it can be to start a new car company from the ground up. But when a company like Sony can partner with an OEM like Honda that already has an established dealer, parts, and service network, it seems like that feat becomes significantly easier.\\n\\nSo that brings me to today's question: Would you buy an EV from an electronics giant like Sony? Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"If you've ever wrenched under the hood of your own car, you know how important it is to be able to diagnose the car with your own tools and buy parts over the counter to button up any issue that might arise. It's why there are so many pushes for right-to-repair laws, and why so many consumer protection advocates argue that putting these tools behind a walled garden is an approach that only hurts buyers and small repair shops\\u2014and owning an EV doesn't change that.\\n\\nWelcome to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about a class action antitrust lawsuit against Tesla moving forward after previously being thrown out, an annual mileage comparison between EVs, hybrids, and ICE vehicles, plus Hyundai readying its all-out assault on the U.S. EV industry that kicks off later this year. Let's jump in.\\n\\n30%: Class Action Against Tesla's Parts and Service Empire Gets Judge's Sign Off\\n\\ntesla service center\\n\\nA U.S. District Judge in California breathed new life into a proposed class action lawsuit originally dismissed last year which alleged Tesla's violations of two key antitrust laws.\\n\\nJudge Trina L. Thompson ruled this week that in light of new evidence, Tesla must stand trial. The automaker faces accusations that it violated the federal Sherman antitrust law and California antitrust law by blocking access to parts and diagnostic tools, as well as refusing to open enough service centers.\\n\\nThe judge originally dismissed the lawsuit last November where consumers had complained of long wait times and high costs of repair. At the time, the judge noted that the class could not prove that the problems were \\\"not generally known,\\\" not that Tesla coerced the class into using its services and parts because consumers had brought the vehicles to Tesla willingly in the first place.\\n\\nHowever, the newest ruling indicates that the judge has found evidence of illegal market \\\"tying\\\"\\u2014that is, attempting to sell a product that requires a buyer to purchase a second product that they did not intend to originally purchase, or cannot purchase that product from a third-party\\u2014which could coerce a customer into making undesired purchases.\\n\\nFrom Reuters:\\n\\nThompson found evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's alleged refusal to open enough authorized service centers, and its designing vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide. Evidence of a parts monopoly included restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \\\"to anyone other than Tesla,\\\" and Tesla's selling parts to consumers only on a limited basis, the judge said. Thompson also found evidence Tesla's alleged illegal \\\"tying\\\" of various markets \\\"coerces customers into undesired purchases.\\\"\\n\\nTesla argued that the lawsuit's complaint was \\\"illogical,\\\" and that the automaker's more profitable side of the business is the sale and leasing of vehicles.\\n\\nTesla recently confirmed that its services arm has recently become profitable during its annual shareholder meeting, calling it \\\"kind of a big deal.\\\" In 2023, the automaker posted an income of $8.3 billion for its services and other automotive revenue\\u2014roughly 9% of its total $96.8 billion revenue.\\n\\n60%: EVs Driven Far Less Than ICE Counterparts In U.S. Says Department of Energy\\n\\nJeep Wrangler 4xe trip mileage\\n\\nDrivers of electric cars are racking up significantly fewer annual miles than drivers of vehicles with competing fuel types according to a publication by the U.S. Department of Energy.\\n\\nAccording to the study, EV drivers averaged approximately 12,400 miles in 2022, which is around 12% less than the average driver of a gasoline-powered car. The DOE says that the average gas-powered platform travels around 14,100 annual miles, or just 100 miles shy of the average of all household vehicles across all fuel types.\\n\\nEVs also average 29% fewer miles than the drivers of diesel vehicles which make up the highest annual travel at 17,500 annual miles. Hybrids (both plug-in and traditional) sit nested in the middle of diesel and gas.\\n\\nWhat's interesting about these statistics, as Green Car Reports points out, is that it's basically the mirror opposite of other major nations that have heavily adopted EVs in recent years.\\n\\nIn other countries, EVs typically accumulate more mileage than their combustion counterparts. Bloomberg New Energy Finance points out that while other countries frequently rack up fewer miles than the U.S., cars with electric power are usually the vehicles with the highest uptick on the odometer. In Norway, for example, EVs travel 40% more than combustion-only vehicles. This number skyrockets to 56% in the Netherlands and 66% in China.\\n\\nIt's not immediately clear why the U.S. differs from the rest of the world in this respect. Could it be the charging infrastructure? We know that the U.S. is working to increase the number of DC fast chargers along major highway corridors to promote the adoption of EVs, and perhaps buyers of EVs now are more likely to be owners who are traveling shorter distances. If so, this figure could flip in the U.S. as EV adoption increases and more chargers are available for longer road trips.\\n\\n90%: Hyundai's American Onslaught Really Begins In Q4\\n\\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5\\n\\nTesla has some competition coming in the EV space, and it's quite literally the entirety of the competing auto industry. Despite a slowdown in adoption, the electric car market is just heating up, and frontrunners like Hyundai are looking to take a piece of that pie. There's just one problem: tax credits.\\n\\nTo solve this issue, many automakers are moving the production of key vehicles stateside. Hyundai is doing exactly that as it plans to open its newest \\\"Metaplant\\\" in Georgia later this fall\\u2014presumably opening up vehicles to become eligible for the $7,500 EV tax credit. And now we know it all begins with the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5.\\n\\nNow, it's fair to assume that Hyundai already let this cat out of the bag last month. Hyundai U.S. CEO Jose Munoz previously noted that it was a \\\"no-brainer\\\" that the Ioniq 5 would need to be the car that kicked it all off in Georgia, but the automaker didn't officially confirm that detail until today.\\n\\nHere's what Hyundai has to say about its Metaplant opening up:\\n\\nWhile the 2025 model of the popular all-electric SUV has yet to be officially unveiled for North America, HMGMA is currently training and preparing to begin production in the fourth quarter of this year. The new plant will produce all trim lines (except IONIQ 5 N) and will eventually be the sole facility building IONIQ 5 models for the U.S. market.\\n\\nThe Ioniq 5 will be just the first vehicle that Hyundai builds there. The plant is planned to have 8,500 employees and a production output of around 300,000 units. For comparison, Hyundai sold just a hair under 34,000 units of the Ioniq 5 in 2023, which means that there is a ton of room to grow. Fortunately, it plans to fill that gap with Genesis and Kia vehicles as well.\\n\\nThis factory launch is key to Hyundai's grasp on the U.S. EV market, and at full capacity, it would enable Hyundai to produce around 25% of the 1.2 million new EVs registered in the U.S. during 2023. Hyundai plans to open its plant in October, almost exactly two years after it first broke ground.\\n\\n100%: If Every EV Was Eligible For The Tax Credit, Which Would You Choose?\\n\\nBefore I bought my Tesla Model 3, I was eyeing a Kia EV6 GT. It was my top pick by a long shot, especially after spending a few weeks with the Ioniq 5 just a few months before I was shopping around.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it wasn't eligible for the EV tax credit\\u2014which at the time couldn't be applied at the point of sale, either. Now that the tax credit is revamped and even fewer vehicles are eligible for the credit, it becomes even more challenging to find a new EV that actually qualifies.\\n\\nSo that makes me wonder: if the tax credit could be applied to every EV on sale in the U.S. today, regardless of its country of origin or sourcing requirements, would if affect what vehicle you would purchase? And if so, which vehicle would end up in your driveway? Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"Hyundai has slashed lease prices in the US for two of its most popular EVs, the Ioniq 5 crossover and Ioniq 6 sedan, by $70 a month.\\n\\nAccording to a national Hyundai dealer incentive bulletin seen by CarsDirect, the 2023 Ioniq 5 SE is now available for $429 a month on a 36-month contract, with $3,999 due at signing. The offer is based on an MSRP of $46,835 for the 303-mile version of the SE trim and 10,000 miles a year of driving. Previously, the same model was offered with a $499 monthly payment.\\n\\nIn similar fashion, the 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE sees a $70 monthly lease payment cut, which means it's also available for $429 a month. Mind you, the effective cost is $540 a month in both cases when including the initial downpayment in the monthly rate.\\n\\nThe reason for the price cuts is that Hyundai is now offering a $7,500 lease incentive on both models, a significant increase over the previous discount of $5,200.\\n\\nGallery: 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 US Spec\\n\\n100\\n\\nThe price cuts also make the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 cheaper to lease than the Tesla Model 3, which is currently offered for $399 for 36 months with $5,594 at signing, which amounts to a total cost of $554 a month.\\n\\nMore specifically, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 \\u2013 a direct competitor for the Model 3 \\u2013 are now $14 per month cheaper to lease than Tesla's base car, whereas before they were $56 more expensive.\\n\\nThis is obviously good news for consumers, and it comes after Hyundai last week also introduced a $1,000 Memorial Day Holiday Bonus on both the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 in some parts of the country.\\n\\nMind you, the bonus does not apply to Limited trims and lease offers \\u2013 it's only for customers who want to purchase the vehicles outright. Speaking of purchasing, the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 don't qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit when bought but are eligible for it when leased.\\n\\nAs with other automakers, Hyundai is taking advantage of an Inflation Reduction Act loophole that protects EVs built outside of North America from being stripped of the federal tax credit.\\n\\nGallery: 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5

Both brands saw stellar results in the first half of 2024 and with some huge industry incentives, it's no surprise why some buyers are flocking to the South Korean marques. So can they keep up that momentum in the second half of this year?\\n\\nWelcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about Hyundai's word of warning regarding sales in the second half of the year, its battle with one dealer group that is claiming inflated sales figures, as well as Honda and Sony's plan to share an EV platform. Let's jump in.\\n\\n30%: Hyundai Warns Of Strong Competition In Second Half Of 2024\\n\\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Review\\n\\nHyundai and Kia both had a fantastic first half of 2024. Between cash on the hood and insane lease deals, your wallet would practically scream at you if you were considering buying anything else.\\n\\nThat being said, Hyundai knows that it's going to have to put in the work to remain on top during the remainder of the year as competition in the EV market begins to really heat up.\\n\\nIn an interview with Automotive News Hyundai CEO Randy Parker spoke about the Korean automaker's outlook on the year, and who it really sees as its big competition moving forward:\\n\\nWe feel pretty bullish about the second half, but it's going to be tough. We've seen a lot of price cuts by our key competitors. Tesla, Ford and Nissan have cut prices this year, and we still have to deal with the consumer fears: affordability, range anxiety and charging infrastructure.\\n\\nPrice is important, sure. So is consumer education. But one thing that Parker didn't exactly touch on is how Hyundai will defend against new products coming to market in the second half of the year, as well as how it plans to stack up against vehicles already launched with improving production numbers. The Hyundai Ioniq 9 may help, but that's a ways off here.\\n\\nS&P Global Mobility analyst Stephanie Brinley says that Hyundai's best chance at a solid defense is also its greatest offense: a strong EV offering.\\n\\nThe automaker has positioned itself as a leader in the EV space, presenting the market with unique EVs that have really caught the public eye\\u2014including that of The Grand Tour and former Top Gear host, Jeremy Clarkson. Now, once it gets its Georgia \\\"Metaplant\\\" online, its vehicles should qualify for the EV tax credit. And if that happens, there's no telling how much market space the automaker can gobble up.\\n\\n60%: Dealer Group Prepares To Go To War With Hyundai Over Claims Of Inflated EV Sales\\n\\nHyundai Dealership\\n\\nAs mentioned above, Hyundai's numbers look great on paper. That's great news for EV adopters and Hyundai's shareholders, especially since the company's stock is up more than 54% this year. However, one group of dealerships has filed suit against Hyundai claiming that its sales figures may be padded.\\n\\nReuters says that the lawsuit claims that Hyundai has a secret and \\\"illegal\\\" program that helps it artificially inflate its sales figures by giving a competitive edge to dealerships who get on board with the program.\\n\\nAccording to the complaint, so-called \\\"punching dealers\\\" are encouraged to convert (\\\"punch\\\") some of its new car inventory into loaner cars through Hyundai's Service Rental Car (SCR) program. Depending on how a dealer codes SRC vehicles, the status change could trigger metrics that count towards a performance program that provides discounts on wholesale vehicles to dealers that meet certain sales objectives.\\n\\nSlow-selling vehicles can be put into this program to make it appear as if they were sold, improving sales performance optics, only to be taken out at a later time after never being used as a loaner car. This has led to some dealers improperly coding SCR vehicles into Hyundai's SCR \\\"slush fund.\\\"\\n\\nFrom the complaint:\\n\\nPunching Dealers not only have artificially lower PEP objectives, they also receive better allocation with which to meet those lower objectives and benefit from the PEP price discounts to increase sales. The result is that Punching Dealers are able to more easily obtain the PEP price discounts due to [Hyundai's] punching scheme. Siphoning off Hyundai\\u2019s best-selling models to Punching Dealers not only makes it easier for them to obtain bonus money through PEP, it also leaves innocent dealers with a model mix of vehicles which are less likely to sell, leaving them to compete for bonus money on an unlevel playing field.\\n\\nOne of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit said that when they failed to \\\"play ball,\\\" they were punished by only receiving allocations of slow-selling vehicles. The suit also claims that those not on board would be denied wholesale pricing discounts, allocations, and retain price discounts. The lawsuit claims this ultimately caused harm to the affected dealerships and the public buying the cars from them.\\n\\nThe scheme is said to have been promoted by Hyundai's middle management. In a call transcript attached to the suit, a District Sales Manager allegedly said he was \\\"tasked\\\" with getting dealers to increase the number of vehicles in the SRC program because he was \\\"up against a number.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Desperate times call for desperate measures,\\\" said the district sales manager, according to the lawsuit. He later continued: \\\"We gotta hit a number for the press and for the Koreans.\\\"\\n\\n90%: Honda's 0 EVs to Share Platform With Sony's Afeela Brand\\n\\n2024 Sony Honda Mobility Afeela prototype\\n\\nIt's no secret that Honda and Sony are working very closely together to make the consumer electronics giant's dreams come true with the Afeela EV brand. Some technology sharing is expected, as is the potential sharing of foundational underpinnings. A new report by Nikkei claims to reveal exactly which platform will be shared by the brands.\\n\\nThat feels like the obvious plan of action, but until now, both brands were mum on what EV platform the Sony project would use.\\n\\nAccording to the report, Afeela vehicles will share the underlying platform with Honda's upcoming line of futuristic-looking EVs, dubbed Honda 0. The sharing of such a low-level structure and its associated components will help both brands cut down on costs, making them both relevant and affordable in a market where cost is currently the key to driving adoption.\\n\\nFrom Nikkei:\\n\\nHonda Motor and Sony Group will use a common platform to manufacture electric vehicles, as the Japanese partners look to reduce the cost of development. The common platform will be found in Honda's 0 Series EVs, as well as electric vehicles to be sold under Afeela, a brand controlled by the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility. The EVs first will be released in North America in 2026. Honda and Sony are prioritizing lower costs and shorter development times in response to the emerging cost competitiveness among Chinese EV manufacturers. Even longtime global leader Tesla is experiencing slower sales in the current environment.\\n\\nNikkei expects that Honda will price mass-market models of the 0 series EVs around $40,000. Prior reports have pegged Afeela with a starting price of around $45,000, though later reports from Nikkei suggested pricing of around 10 million yen, or north of $62,000 USD. Afeela is designated as a high-end brand, though it's expected to use the same platform as the mass-market vehicles in Honda's 0 series. Sony says that Afeela will set itself apart by offering unique in-vehicle experiences, like the ability to remotely connect to the owner's PlayStation.\\n\\nAfeela is slated to launch its first car in 2026 with a sedan based on its Vision concept. Shortly after, it anticipates including an SUV and a second sedan.\\n\\n100%: Would You Buy An EV Branded By An Electronics Giant?\\n\\nXiaomi SU7\\n\\nPeople jokingly call EVs appliances, but when we see off-the-shelf electronic makers like Sony and Xiaomi dip their toes into the EV waters, it's entirely possible that others will do the same.\\n\\nNow, sure, building a car isn't easy. After all, Apple called it quits and we've seen just how hard it can be to start a new car company from the ground up. But when a company like Sony can partner with an OEM like Honda that already has an established dealer, parts, and service network, it seems like that feat becomes significantly easier.\\n\\nSo that brings me to today's question: Would you buy an EV from an electronics giant like Sony? Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"If you've ever wrenched under the hood of your own car, you know how important it is to be able to diagnose the car with your own tools and buy parts over the counter to button up any issue that might arise. It's why there are so many pushes for right-to-repair laws, and why so many consumer protection advocates argue that putting these tools behind a walled garden is an approach that only hurts buyers and small repair shops\\u2014and owning an EV doesn't change that.\\n\\nWelcome to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about a class action antitrust lawsuit against Tesla moving forward after previously being thrown out, an annual mileage comparison between EVs, hybrids, and ICE vehicles, plus Hyundai readying its all-out assault on the U.S. EV industry that kicks off later this year. Let's jump in.\\n\\n30%: Class Action Against Tesla's Parts and Service Empire Gets Judge's Sign Off\\n\\ntesla service center\\n\\nA U.S. District Judge in California breathed new life into a proposed class action lawsuit originally dismissed last year which alleged Tesla's violations of two key antitrust laws.\\n\\nJudge Trina L. Thompson ruled this week that in light of new evidence, Tesla must stand trial. The automaker faces accusations that it violated the federal Sherman antitrust law and California antitrust law by blocking access to parts and diagnostic tools, as well as refusing to open enough service centers.\\n\\nThe judge originally dismissed the lawsuit last November where consumers had complained of long wait times and high costs of repair. At the time, the judge noted that the class could not prove that the problems were \\\"not generally known,\\\" not that Tesla coerced the class into using its services and parts because consumers had brought the vehicles to Tesla willingly in the first place.\\n\\nHowever, the newest ruling indicates that the judge has found evidence of illegal market \\\"tying\\\"\\u2014that is, attempting to sell a product that requires a buyer to purchase a second product that they did not intend to originally purchase, or cannot purchase that product from a third-party\\u2014which could coerce a customer into making undesired purchases.\\n\\nFrom Reuters:\\n\\nThompson found evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's alleged refusal to open enough authorized service centers, and its designing vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide. Evidence of a parts monopoly included restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \\\"to anyone other than Tesla,\\\" and Tesla's selling parts to consumers only on a limited basis, the judge said. Thompson also found evidence Tesla's alleged illegal \\\"tying\\\" of various markets \\\"coerces customers into undesired purchases.\\\"\\n\\nTesla argued that the lawsuit's complaint was \\\"illogical,\\\" and that the automaker's more profitable side of the business is the sale and leasing of vehicles.\\n\\nTesla recently confirmed that its services arm has recently become profitable during its annual shareholder meeting, calling it \\\"kind of a big deal.\\\" In 2023, the automaker posted an income of $8.3 billion for its services and other automotive revenue\\u2014roughly 9% of its total $96.8 billion revenue.\\n\\n60%: EVs Driven Far Less Than ICE Counterparts In U.S. Says Department of Energy\\n\\nJeep Wrangler 4xe trip mileage\\n\\nDrivers of electric cars are racking up significantly fewer annual miles than drivers of vehicles with competing fuel types according to a publication by the U.S. Department of Energy.\\n\\nAccording to the study, EV drivers averaged approximately 12,400 miles in 2022, which is around 12% less than the average driver of a gasoline-powered car. The DOE says that the average gas-powered platform travels around 14,100 annual miles, or just 100 miles shy of the average of all household vehicles across all fuel types.\\n\\nEVs also average 29% fewer miles than the drivers of diesel vehicles which make up the highest annual travel at 17,500 annual miles. Hybrids (both plug-in and traditional) sit nested in the middle of diesel and gas.\\n\\nWhat's interesting about these statistics, as Green Car Reports points out, is that it's basically the mirror opposite of other major nations that have heavily adopted EVs in recent years.\\n\\nIn other countries, EVs typically accumulate more mileage than their combustion counterparts. Bloomberg New Energy Finance points out that while other countries frequently rack up fewer miles than the U.S., cars with electric power are usually the vehicles with the highest uptick on the odometer. In Norway, for example, EVs travel 40% more than combustion-only vehicles. This number skyrockets to 56% in the Netherlands and 66% in China.\\n\\nIt's not immediately clear why the U.S. differs from the rest of the world in this respect. Could it be the charging infrastructure? We know that the U.S. is working to increase the number of DC fast chargers along major highway corridors to promote the adoption of EVs, and perhaps buyers of EVs now are more likely to be owners who are traveling shorter distances. If so, this figure could flip in the U.S. as EV adoption increases and more chargers are available for longer road trips.\\n\\n90%: Hyundai's American Onslaught Really Begins In Q4\\n\\n2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5\\n\\nTesla has some competition coming in the EV space, and it's quite literally the entirety of the competing auto industry. Despite a slowdown in adoption, the electric car market is just heating up, and frontrunners like Hyundai are looking to take a piece of that pie. There's just one problem: tax credits.\\n\\nTo solve this issue, many automakers are moving the production of key vehicles stateside. Hyundai is doing exactly that as it plans to open its newest \\\"Metaplant\\\" in Georgia later this fall\\u2014presumably opening up vehicles to become eligible for the $7,500 EV tax credit. And now we know it all begins with the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5.\\n\\nNow, it's fair to assume that Hyundai already let this cat out of the bag last month. Hyundai U.S. CEO Jose Munoz previously noted that it was a \\\"no-brainer\\\" that the Ioniq 5 would need to be the car that kicked it all off in Georgia, but the automaker didn't officially confirm that detail until today.\\n\\nHere's what Hyundai has to say about its Metaplant opening up:\\n\\nWhile the 2025 model of the popular all-electric SUV has yet to be officially unveiled for North America, HMGMA is currently training and preparing to begin production in the fourth quarter of this year. The new plant will produce all trim lines (except IONIQ 5 N) and will eventually be the sole facility building IONIQ 5 models for the U.S. market.\\n\\nThe Ioniq 5 will be just the first vehicle that Hyundai builds there. The plant is planned to have 8,500 employees and a production output of around 300,000 units. For comparison, Hyundai sold just a hair under 34,000 units of the Ioniq 5 in 2023, which means that there is a ton of room to grow. Fortunately, it plans to fill that gap with Genesis and Kia vehicles as well.\\n\\nThis factory launch is key to Hyundai's grasp on the U.S. EV market, and at full capacity, it would enable Hyundai to produce around 25% of the 1.2 million new EVs registered in the U.S. during 2023. Hyundai plans to open its plant in October, almost exactly two years after it first broke ground.\\n\\n100%: If Every EV Was Eligible For The Tax Credit, Which Would You Choose?\\n\\nBefore I bought my Tesla Model 3, I was eyeing a Kia EV6 GT. It was my top pick by a long shot, especially after spending a few weeks with the Ioniq 5 just a few months before I was shopping around.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it wasn't eligible for the EV tax credit\\u2014which at the time couldn't be applied at the point of sale, either. Now that the tax credit is revamped and even fewer vehicles are eligible for the credit, it becomes even more challenging to find a new EV that actually qualifies.\\n\\nSo that makes me wonder: if the tax credit could be applied to every EV on sale in the U.S. today, regardless of its country of origin or sourcing requirements, would if affect what vehicle you would purchase? And if so, which vehicle would end up in your driveway? Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"Hyundai has slashed lease prices in the US for two of its most popular EVs, the Ioniq 5 crossover and Ioniq 6 sedan, by $70 a month.\\n\\nAccording to a national Hyundai dealer incentive bulletin seen by CarsDirect, the 2023 Ioniq 5 SE is now available for $429 a month on a 36-month contract, with $3,999 due at signing. The offer is based on an MSRP of $46,835 for the 303-mile version of the SE trim and 10,000 miles a year of driving. Previously, the same model was offered with a $499 monthly payment.\\n\\nIn similar fashion, the 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE sees a $70 monthly lease payment cut, which means it's also available for $429 a month. Mind you, the effective cost is $540 a month in both cases when including the initial downpayment in the monthly rate.\\n\\nThe reason for the price cuts is that Hyundai is now offering a $7,500 lease incentive on both models, a significant increase over the previous discount of $5,200.\\n\\nGallery: 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 US Spec\\n\\n100\\n\\nThe price cuts also make the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 cheaper to lease than the Tesla Model 3, which is currently offered for $399 for 36 months with $5,594 at signing, which amounts to a total cost of $554 a month.\\n\\nMore specifically, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 \\u2013 a direct competitor for the Model 3 \\u2013 are now $14 per month cheaper to lease than Tesla's base car, whereas before they were $56 more expensive.\\n\\nThis is obviously good news for consumers, and it comes after Hyundai last week also introduced a $1,000 Memorial Day Holiday Bonus on both the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 in some parts of the country.\\n\\nMind you, the bonus does not apply to Limited trims and lease offers \\u2013 it's only for customers who want to purchase the vehicles outright. Speaking of purchasing, the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 don't qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit when bought but are eligible for it when leased.\\n\\nAs with other automakers, Hyundai is taking advantage of an Inflation Reduction Act loophole that protects EVs built outside of North America from being stripped of the federal tax credit.\\n\\nGallery: 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 (US)\\n\\n61\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 31,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"20230427\",\n          \"20240702\",\n          \"20230623\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["urls4 = [\"https://insideevs.com/news/742393/kia-phev-60-miles-electric-range/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/741881/kia-trump-ev-tax-credit/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/735373/kia-hack-cyber-security-researcher/\",\n","         \"https://insideevs.com/news/734188/kia-stinger-electric-successor-legacy/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/734124/kia-pbv-electric-vans-europe/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/732758/upcoming-popular-evs-google-search/\",\n","         \"https://insideevs.com/news/731619/hyundai-hybrid-v2l/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/730672/south-korea-ev-fire-panic/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/729924/vw-trinity-golf-ev-delay/\",\n","         \"https://insideevs.com/news/728862/kia-ev4-spotted-europe/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/725266/average-ev-price-less-tesla/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/724328/hyundai-kia-ioniq-5-gameboy/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/720934/kia-ev3-why-it-matters/\",\n","         \"https://insideevs.com/news/720641/kia-ev3-why-fwd/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/719554/2025-kia-ev6-facelift-bigger-battery/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/683132/cheaper-kia-ray-ev-minicar-returns-korean-market-more-range-power/\",\n","         \"https://insideevs.com/news/681970/2025-kia-ev5-leaked-china-stays-true-concept/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/680212/kia-stops-taking-ev9-reservations-canada/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/673466/tesla-not-on-top-10-best-evs-list-2023/\",\n","         \"https://insideevs.com/news/673338/hyundai-motor-group-kia-genesis-electric-truck/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/672899/kia-to-expand-electric-lineup-from-ev1-to-ev9/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/672854/kia-ev-deliveries-have-already-begun-south-korea/\",\n","         \"https://insideevs.com/news/667551/kia-makes-2023-ev6-more-attractive-lease-purchase-us/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/666499/kia-ev9-cold-weather-testing-battery-preconditioning/\", \"https://insideevs.com/news/659603/kia-ceo-confirms-ev9-gt-as-high-performance-variant-coming-in-2025/\"]"],"metadata":{"id":"PK7ZsNv1nhRx"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data4 = []\n","\n","for url in urls4:\n","  article = Article(url)\n","  article.download()\n","  article.parse()\n","  data4.append({\"title\": article.title, \"article\": article.text})"],"metadata":{"id":"um5Mqtz5ngow"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df4 = pd.DataFrame(data4)"],"metadata":{"id":"ZCUi1oTDnj4m"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df4"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":833},"id":"mMO3CwEMqh5f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732780043341,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"채형김","userId":"13447971630655102369"}},"outputId":"dd92ce6b-e026-4a04-fc8a-d14dccdc6df0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                title  \\\n","0   Kia Eyes PHEVs With 60 Miles Of Electric Range...   \n","1   'It Would Just Be Dumb': Kia Exec On Plan To K...   \n","2   Hackers Get Keys to Any Kia With Just A Licens...   \n","3   Kia Stinger Replacement Could Go Electric.

This has led to a sliding scale of sales expectations so that automakers can be more flexible in adjusting rollout strategies to meet consumer demand more accurately. Volkswagen is taking full advantage of its flexible strategy and is now reportedly changing the planned model order to better fit the changing EV market.\\n\\nWelcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about VW's pushback of its flagship \\\"Project Trinity\\\" EV, Tesla's conflicting use of government subsidies, and battery fires in South Korea. Let's jump in.\\n\\n30%: VW's Flagship \\\"Trinity\\\" EV May Be Delayed In Favor Of Electric Golf\\n\\nVolkswagen has decided to once again delay its flagship \\\"Project Trinity\\\" EV. According to recent reports from German news outlet Handelsblatt, the automaker's decision comes as part of a priority reshuffling that could favor the early launch of a battery-electric Golf instead.\\n\\nReports indicate that the automaker has chosen to abandon its original timeline of 2026 so it can better recoup its investments into current-generation underpinnings. VW is now reportedly earmarking the release of the BEV sedan for 2032.\\n\\nAutomotive News explains the reasoning behind the significant delay:\\n\\nThe delay is part of a reallocation of product launch investments by VW Group CEO Oliver Blume. It would allow the group's existing EV platforms\\u2014MEB used by VW's ID cars and PPE used for the Porsche electric Macan and Audi Q6 E-tron\\u2014to be used for longer so that their investment costs can be better amortized. The MEB platform is due to be upgraded to MEB+ in 2026 and the PPE platform will get a software upgrade within the next 36 months with help from VW Group's new partner Rivian, Handelsblatt said. The postponement is also a reaction of the slowdown of the EV market and Blume's cost-cutting drive, sources told the paper.\\n\\nThe new product rollout will now reportedly prioritize a fully-electric Golf (codenamed \\\"ID Golf\\\") as the first vehicle to launch on the new SSP underpinnings in 2026, followed by a fully-electric Audi A4 in 2028. The report also claims that Volkswagen's ID.4 successor would be pushed back from 2028 until 2030 and a BEV crossover delayed from 2029 to 2031.\\n\\nOriginally announced in early 2021 under VW's former dieselgate-era CEO Herbert Diess, Project Trinity is set to be Volkswagen's flagship successor to the ID family of vehicles. Not only was Trinity planned to be the first car to ride on VW's Scalable Systems Platform (SSP)\\u2014the upcoming modular platform that is said to offer faster charging and up to 1,700 horsepower\\u2014but it is also poised to debut some Level 4 self-driving features.\\n\\nCurrent VW CEO Oliver Blume has already delayed the EV once before in 2022. The first delay pushed it back from 2026 to 2030 over software concerns\\u2014a concern that is hopefully now moot with VW's new $5 billion Rivian partnership. The delay also solidifies the automaker's previous plans to extend its MEB platform until 2030.\\n\\n60%: Charge, Baby, Charge: Tesla's Insatiable Appetite For Subsidies And Government Support\\n\\n\\\"Take away the subsidies,\\\" wrote Tesla CEO Elon Musk on his social media platform, X, just last month. \\\"It will only help Tesla.\\\"\\n\\nMusk was, of course, referring to the $7,500 EV tax credit which has helped to fuel the success of Tesla over the years, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future as long as the automaker continues to build vehicles compliant with the program's requirements.\\n\\nBut Despite Musk's sentiment towards tax credits and government subsidies, Tesla has continued to show that its opinion vastly differs from that of its CEOs. And as noted in a recent report from Reuters, Tesla has established a clear pattern of lobbying in favor for regulation that directly opposes its CEO's public cry for less government-provided support.\\n\\nFrom Reuters:\\n\\nIn February, for instance, Tesla in a filing with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, urged the Biden administration to allow California to pursue stricter vehicle emissions rules than the rest of the country\\u2014an idea Trump opposes. Months earlier, in a previous filing with the agency, Tesla lobbied the government for regulations that would ban the production of most new gasoline cars by 2035\\u2014the so-called \\\"EV mandate\\\" that Trump and others on the American right have criticized. The disparity is hardly the first time that the billionaire entrepreneur\\u2014himself increasingly dismissive of subsidies\\u2014has sent mixed signals on business and politics.\\n\\nTesla has a history of gobbling up whatever taxpayer-sponsored subsidies that benefits it. As Reuters outlined above, Tesla's biggest sale as of late has been the sale of regulatory credits, which alone bolstered its bottom line by $890 million in the second quarter of 2024.\\n\\nTesla has also changed the way it does business in order to take advantage of government-sponsored funding. In Canada, for example, the automaker launched a compliance-spec Model 3 with just 94 miles of range, which, yes, people bought. And in France, Tesla offers the Model Y in a two-seater configuration in order to qualify for a tax break for business-to-business customers.\\n\\nReuters outlines other examples of Tesla's use\\u2014and push for\\u2014government support and subsidies through its previous actions:\\n\\n[T]he public record clearly shows that Tesla, since its founding over two decades ago, has benefitted from government assistance, largely because of its role in moving the U.S. toward cleaner cars. Tesla's first major manufacturing facility, in Fremont, California, was developed with the help of a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, repaid three years later. More recently, Tesla has reaped almost $9 billion since 2018 by selling what are known as \\\"regulatory credits, opens new tab,\\\" securities filings show. The credits, awarded in the U.S. by the federal and state governments to manufacturers who surpass increasingly strict emissions rules, can be sold to other carmakers who are unable to comply. \\\"There was no Tesla without California's regulatory bodies,\\\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a 2022 conference, citing the importance of the state's credits to the carmaker's finances. A Reuters review of Congressional lobbying records\\u2014and Tesla's public comments to federal and state regulators\\u2014shows that the company has continued working to shape public policy in favor of such benefits. Earlier this year, in a February filing with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Tesla said that sustained government support, by accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels, would \\\"mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and protect the country's public health and welfare.\\\"\\n\\nIt's unclear if Musk's words are a strong marketing tactic to pursue more conservative buyers, or if the CEO's opinions vastly differs from the company's actions. In a recent interview with former president Donald Trump, Musk said that the world shouldn't \\\"vilify the oil and gas industry\\\" because the climate risk \\\"is not as high\\\" or immediate as some experts stress. Previously, Musk publicly supported carbon taxes in order to combat both pollution and offset subsidies which help make petroleum-based fuels less expensive.\\n\\nIn Tesla's defense, if the government is offering a discount or advantage for consumers to buy your product, it seems to be in the best fiduciary interest of the company to take advantage of it. However, on the other hand, its CEO calling to end those very programs because they are unnecessary to the organization's success feels like an unwise chess move.\\n\\n90%: BMW, Mercedes Battery Makers Revealed After South Korea Urges Transparency Following Fires\\n\\nThe government of South Korea is urging automakers for more transparency\\u2014specifically, voluntary disclosure of the manufacturers of batteries used in their vehicles.\\n\\nOfficials are responding to \\\"EV phobia\\\" after lithium fires in battery-electric cars have sparked public concern across the country in recent weeks. In particular, Korean citizens are on edge after a Mercedes-Benz EQE burst into flames earlier this month and damaged 140 vehicles in an underground parking garage during the eight-hour blaze.\\n\\nFollowing the fire, automakers have begun to publicly disclose the batteries used in their EVs\\u2014at least in the Korean market. Bloomberg called the disclosure \\\"a rare move,\\\" noting that car makers typically keep this information confidential but appear to be willing to publish it as a means of transparency given current events.\\n\\nMercedes revealed cells supplied LG Energy Solution (LGES), CATL, SK, and Farasis Energy. BMW revealed that its cars use cells supplied by Samsung SDI and CATL. Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis use cells provided by LGES, SK, and CATL.\\n\\nAccording to reports from local media, the EQE that caught fire in early August was using batteries from China's Farasis Energy, though there is no current correlation noted between a battery cell manufacturer and the risk of fire. Mercedes is currently offering free inspections of all of its EVs in Korea and has drawn up a fund of $3.3 million to help individuals affected by the fire. An investigation into the blaze is still ongoing.\\n\\n\\\"It\\u2019s difficult to tell at this point whether Farasis batteries are the problem, but there\\u2019s a general sentiment that the risk is higher with smaller battery makers than major producers like CATL or Korean makers,\\\" said Korean-based DS Asset Management Co. fund manager, Yoon Joonwon, in a statement to Bloomberg. \\\"Until the issue is resolved, consumer sentiment toward EVs is expected to remain deteriorated for some time.\\\"\\n\\nSouth Korea's Office for Government Policy Coordination says that it has discussed EV safety concerns with industry experts and related government departments. Officials will develop comprehensive safety measures in the coming months to address its concerns.\\n\\n100%: Has The EV Tax Credit Helped You Decide On A Battery-Electric Car?\\n\\nThe EV tax credit is one of the most powerful tools that any car buyer considering an EV can leverage right now. It's far from being free money, but for many, it sure feels that way when they can simply eliminate $7,500 off the bottom line with the stroke of a pen.\\n\\nWhen I was shopping around for an EV last year, it was one of my main concerns. In fact, I passed up on some of my more preferential EVs (like the Kia EV6 GT) because the cars didn't qualify for the EV tax credit. And I expect to set that same expectation for whatever EV I purchase next as well\\u2014assuming the credit is still around after November, that is.\\n\\nThose of you who have purchased an EV (or are looking to purchase an EV): has the tax credit influenced your decisions? Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"The Kia EV5 electric compact SUV, the brand's third electric vehicle based on the E-GMP architecture, has been leaked in China.\\n\\nThe photos published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and picked up by CarNewsChina fully reveal the EV5's exterior design, though it has to be said that the vehicle you see in the photos is for the Chinese market. Still, the Kia EV5 should look largely the same in other markets.\\n\\nRemarkably, the production model looks very similar to the Concept EV5 unveiled in March, with only minor changes such as the adoption of traditional side mirrors, flush door handles \\u2013 the concept had no visible handles \\u2013 smaller wheels, and slightly revised headlights and taillights.\\n\\nSpeaking of the rims, while they retain the same design seen on the concept, they are 18- or 19-inches in size compared to 21 inches on the study.\\n\\nFrom a design standpoint, the EV5 is closer to the Kia EV9 than the EV6, adopting an upright SUV body style instead of a raised hatchback look like the EV6. It looks like a downsized version of the EV9, which in many ways, it is.\\n\\nBoth models use the E-GMP EV-dedicated platform, but the EV5 is smaller, accommodating five passengers on two rows of seats instead of seven on three rows. According to information shared on MIIT's website, the Kia EV5 is 181.7 inches long, 73.8 in wide and 67.5 in high, with a wheelbase of 108.2 in.\\n\\nThis makes it roughly just as long and wide as the Kia EV6, although it's significantly higher and it has a 16-inch shorter wheelbase. The photos do not show the interior, but the production model's cabin is likely less futuristic than what we saw on the concept.\\n\\nThe MIIT filing also reveals that the Kia EV5 features an LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) Blade battery from BYD subsidiary Xiangyang Fudi Battery Co (FinDreams), which powers a rear-mounted electric motor rated at 215 horsepower (160 kilowatts) and 229 pound-feet of torque. No details about a dual-motor AWD variant have been released, but it's difficult to imagine Kia wouldn't offer it later on.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the overseas version of the Kia EV5 may not feature an LFP battery; The Korean Car Blog previously reported that the EV5 would get an 82-kilowatt-hour NMC pack outside China, which would enable up to 373 miles of range.\\n\\nThe Kia EV5 will be produced in China by the Kia-Yueda joint venture at its plant in Yancheng. Vehicles made there will be sold in China and exported to some markets, as Kia-Yueda previously said the EV5 is its first China-made global EV.\\n\\nThe EV5 will officially debut on August 25 at the Chengdu Motor Show, but pre-sales will kick off in November.\\n\\nSource: MIIT via CarNewsChina\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"Kia's plug-in hybrids might offer 60 miles of electric range in a \\\"couple of years.\\\"\\n\\nThe statement comes from Steven Center, Kia America's chief operating officer and executive vice president.\\n\\nCurrent Kia PHEVs can deliver roughly 30 miles of electric range.\\n\\nBesides kicking things into high gear in the all-electric vehicle game, Kia also wants to increase its footprint in the plug-in hybrid vehicle market. Not only by offering more battery-assisted cars which are more fuel efficient if plugged in regularly, but also by upping the maximum range of these models while running on battery power.\\n\\nCurrently, Kia\\u2019s PHEVs can cover up to 34 miles on electricity with a full battery before kicking in the gas engine. This could be enough for drivers who only do short journeys and can recharge at home, but how would 60 miles of all-electric range sound?\\n\\nThat\\u2019s almost double the number available today. It would significantly open up the market to people who wouldn\\u2019t consider a battery-powered car otherwise. They could drive the car on electricity most of the time for the usual errands around town and then fill up the gas tank if a long trip is coming up.\\n\\nWith battery tech advancing at a rapid pace and new vehicle platforms designed to fit bigger battery packs for gas-powered cars, these 60-mile PHEVs might come in as little as \\u201ca couple of years,\\u201d according to Steven Center, Kia America\\u2019s chief operating officer and executive vice president, who spoke with Green Car Reports during the Los Angeles Auto Show.\\n\\nThe 60-mile figure came from an \\u201cengineering statistic,\\u201d Center said, and it relates to the total daily driving distance for Americans. According to data from mobility analytics platform Replica, people in the United States travel a nationwide average of 42 daily miles. This includes all forms of transportation, including personal vehicles, mass transit, biking and walking.\\n\\nThe 2025 Kia Sportage PHEV has an all-electric EPA-rated range of 34 miles.\\n\\nAt the same time, a study from the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland showed that 52% of all trips made by Americans in 2021 were shorter than three miles and just 2% of trips were longer than 50 miles.

This has led to a sliding scale of sales expectations so that automakers can be more flexible in adjusting rollout strategies to meet consumer demand more accurately. Volkswagen is taking full advantage of its flexible strategy and is now reportedly changing the planned model order to better fit the changing EV market.\\n\\nWelcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about VW's pushback of its flagship \\\"Project Trinity\\\" EV, Tesla's conflicting use of government subsidies, and battery fires in South Korea. Let's jump in.\\n\\n30%: VW's Flagship \\\"Trinity\\\" EV May Be Delayed In Favor Of Electric Golf\\n\\nVolkswagen has decided to once again delay its flagship \\\"Project Trinity\\\" EV. According to recent reports from German news outlet Handelsblatt, the automaker's decision comes as part of a priority reshuffling that could favor the early launch of a battery-electric Golf instead.\\n\\nReports indicate that the automaker has chosen to abandon its original timeline of 2026 so it can better recoup its investments into current-generation underpinnings. VW is now reportedly earmarking the release of the BEV sedan for 2032.\\n\\nAutomotive News explains the reasoning behind the significant delay:\\n\\nThe delay is part of a reallocation of product launch investments by VW Group CEO Oliver Blume. It would allow the group's existing EV platforms\\u2014MEB used by VW's ID cars and PPE used for the Porsche electric Macan and Audi Q6 E-tron\\u2014to be used for longer so that their investment costs can be better amortized. The MEB platform is due to be upgraded to MEB+ in 2026 and the PPE platform will get a software upgrade within the next 36 months with help from VW Group's new partner Rivian, Handelsblatt said. The postponement is also a reaction of the slowdown of the EV market and Blume's cost-cutting drive, sources told the paper.\\n\\nThe new product rollout will now reportedly prioritize a fully-electric Golf (codenamed \\\"ID Golf\\\") as the first vehicle to launch on the new SSP underpinnings in 2026, followed by a fully-electric Audi A4 in 2028. The report also claims that Volkswagen's ID.4 successor would be pushed back from 2028 until 2030 and a BEV crossover delayed from 2029 to 2031.\\n\\nOriginally announced in early 2021 under VW's former dieselgate-era CEO Herbert Diess, Project Trinity is set to be Volkswagen's flagship successor to the ID family of vehicles. Not only was Trinity planned to be the first car to ride on VW's Scalable Systems Platform (SSP)\\u2014the upcoming modular platform that is said to offer faster charging and up to 1,700 horsepower\\u2014but it is also poised to debut some Level 4 self-driving features.\\n\\nCurrent VW CEO Oliver Blume has already delayed the EV once before in 2022. The first delay pushed it back from 2026 to 2030 over software concerns\\u2014a concern that is hopefully now moot with VW's new $5 billion Rivian partnership. The delay also solidifies the automaker's previous plans to extend its MEB platform until 2030.\\n\\n60%: Charge, Baby, Charge: Tesla's Insatiable Appetite For Subsidies And Government Support\\n\\n\\\"Take away the subsidies,\\\" wrote Tesla CEO Elon Musk on his social media platform, X, just last month. \\\"It will only help Tesla.\\\"\\n\\nMusk was, of course, referring to the $7,500 EV tax credit which has helped to fuel the success of Tesla over the years, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future as long as the automaker continues to build vehicles compliant with the program's requirements.\\n\\nBut Despite Musk's sentiment towards tax credits and government subsidies, Tesla has continued to show that its opinion vastly differs from that of its CEOs. And as noted in a recent report from Reuters, Tesla has established a clear pattern of lobbying in favor for regulation that directly opposes its CEO's public cry for less government-provided support.\\n\\nFrom Reuters:\\n\\nIn February, for instance, Tesla in a filing with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, urged the Biden administration to allow California to pursue stricter vehicle emissions rules than the rest of the country\\u2014an idea Trump opposes. Months earlier, in a previous filing with the agency, Tesla lobbied the government for regulations that would ban the production of most new gasoline cars by 2035\\u2014the so-called \\\"EV mandate\\\" that Trump and others on the American right have criticized. The disparity is hardly the first time that the billionaire entrepreneur\\u2014himself increasingly dismissive of subsidies\\u2014has sent mixed signals on business and politics.\\n\\nTesla has a history of gobbling up whatever taxpayer-sponsored subsidies that benefits it. As Reuters outlined above, Tesla's biggest sale as of late has been the sale of regulatory credits, which alone bolstered its bottom line by $890 million in the second quarter of 2024.\\n\\nTesla has also changed the way it does business in order to take advantage of government-sponsored funding. In Canada, for example, the automaker launched a compliance-spec Model 3 with just 94 miles of range, which, yes, people bought. And in France, Tesla offers the Model Y in a two-seater configuration in order to qualify for a tax break for business-to-business customers.\\n\\nReuters outlines other examples of Tesla's use\\u2014and push for\\u2014government support and subsidies through its previous actions:\\n\\n[T]he public record clearly shows that Tesla, since its founding over two decades ago, has benefitted from government assistance, largely because of its role in moving the U.S. toward cleaner cars. Tesla's first major manufacturing facility, in Fremont, California, was developed with the help of a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, repaid three years later. More recently, Tesla has reaped almost $9 billion since 2018 by selling what are known as \\\"regulatory credits, opens new tab,\\\" securities filings show. The credits, awarded in the U.S. by the federal and state governments to manufacturers who surpass increasingly strict emissions rules, can be sold to other carmakers who are unable to comply. \\\"There was no Tesla without California's regulatory bodies,\\\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a 2022 conference, citing the importance of the state's credits to the carmaker's finances. A Reuters review of Congressional lobbying records\\u2014and Tesla's public comments to federal and state regulators\\u2014shows that the company has continued working to shape public policy in favor of such benefits. Earlier this year, in a February filing with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Tesla said that sustained government support, by accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels, would \\\"mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and protect the country's public health and welfare.\\\"\\n\\nIt's unclear if Musk's words are a strong marketing tactic to pursue more conservative buyers, or if the CEO's opinions vastly differs from the company's actions. In a recent interview with former president Donald Trump, Musk said that the world shouldn't \\\"vilify the oil and gas industry\\\" because the climate risk \\\"is not as high\\\" or immediate as some experts stress. Previously, Musk publicly supported carbon taxes in order to combat both pollution and offset subsidies which help make petroleum-based fuels less expensive.\\n\\nIn Tesla's defense, if the government is offering a discount or advantage for consumers to buy your product, it seems to be in the best fiduciary interest of the company to take advantage of it. However, on the other hand, its CEO calling to end those very programs because they are unnecessary to the organization's success feels like an unwise chess move.\\n\\n90%: BMW, Mercedes Battery Makers Revealed After South Korea Urges Transparency Following Fires\\n\\nThe government of South Korea is urging automakers for more transparency\\u2014specifically, voluntary disclosure of the manufacturers of batteries used in their vehicles.\\n\\nOfficials are responding to \\\"EV phobia\\\" after lithium fires in battery-electric cars have sparked public concern across the country in recent weeks. In particular, Korean citizens are on edge after a Mercedes-Benz EQE burst into flames earlier this month and damaged 140 vehicles in an underground parking garage during the eight-hour blaze.\\n\\nFollowing the fire, automakers have begun to publicly disclose the batteries used in their EVs\\u2014at least in the Korean market. Bloomberg called the disclosure \\\"a rare move,\\\" noting that car makers typically keep this information confidential but appear to be willing to publish it as a means of transparency given current events.\\n\\nMercedes revealed cells supplied LG Energy Solution (LGES), CATL, SK, and Farasis Energy. BMW revealed that its cars use cells supplied by Samsung SDI and CATL. Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis use cells provided by LGES, SK, and CATL.\\n\\nAccording to reports from local media, the EQE that caught fire in early August was using batteries from China's Farasis Energy, though there is no current correlation noted between a battery cell manufacturer and the risk of fire. Mercedes is currently offering free inspections of all of its EVs in Korea and has drawn up a fund of $3.3 million to help individuals affected by the fire. An investigation into the blaze is still ongoing.\\n\\n\\\"It\\u2019s difficult to tell at this point whether Farasis batteries are the problem, but there\\u2019s a general sentiment that the risk is higher with smaller battery makers than major producers like CATL or Korean makers,\\\" said Korean-based DS Asset Management Co. fund manager, Yoon Joonwon, in a statement to Bloomberg. \\\"Until the issue is resolved, consumer sentiment toward EVs is expected to remain deteriorated for some time.\\\"\\n\\nSouth Korea's Office for Government Policy Coordination says that it has discussed EV safety concerns with industry experts and related government departments. Officials will develop comprehensive safety measures in the coming months to address its concerns.\\n\\n100%: Has The EV Tax Credit Helped You Decide On A Battery-Electric Car?\\n\\nThe EV tax credit is one of the most powerful tools that any car buyer considering an EV can leverage right now. It's far from being free money, but for many, it sure feels that way when they can simply eliminate $7,500 off the bottom line with the stroke of a pen.\\n\\nWhen I was shopping around for an EV last year, it was one of my main concerns. In fact, I passed up on some of my more preferential EVs (like the Kia EV6 GT) because the cars didn't qualify for the EV tax credit. And I expect to set that same expectation for whatever EV I purchase next as well\\u2014assuming the credit is still around after November, that is.\\n\\nThose of you who have purchased an EV (or are looking to purchase an EV): has the tax credit influenced your decisions? Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"The Kia EV5 electric compact SUV, the brand's third electric vehicle based on the E-GMP architecture, has been leaked in China.\\n\\nThe photos published by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and picked up by CarNewsChina fully reveal the EV5's exterior design, though it has to be said that the vehicle you see in the photos is for the Chinese market. Still, the Kia EV5 should look largely the same in other markets.\\n\\nRemarkably, the production model looks very similar to the Concept EV5 unveiled in March, with only minor changes such as the adoption of traditional side mirrors, flush door handles \\u2013 the concept had no visible handles \\u2013 smaller wheels, and slightly revised headlights and taillights.\\n\\nSpeaking of the rims, while they retain the same design seen on the concept, they are 18- or 19-inches in size compared to 21 inches on the study.\\n\\nFrom a design standpoint, the EV5 is closer to the Kia EV9 than the EV6, adopting an upright SUV body style instead of a raised hatchback look like the EV6. It looks like a downsized version of the EV9, which in many ways, it is.\\n\\nBoth models use the E-GMP EV-dedicated platform, but the EV5 is smaller, accommodating five passengers on two rows of seats instead of seven on three rows. According to information shared on MIIT's website, the Kia EV5 is 181.7 inches long, 73.8 in wide and 67.5 in high, with a wheelbase of 108.2 in.\\n\\nThis makes it roughly just as long and wide as the Kia EV6, although it's significantly higher and it has a 16-inch shorter wheelbase. The photos do not show the interior, but the production model's cabin is likely less futuristic than what we saw on the concept.\\n\\nThe MIIT filing also reveals that the Kia EV5 features an LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) Blade battery from BYD subsidiary Xiangyang Fudi Battery Co (FinDreams), which powers a rear-mounted electric motor rated at 215 horsepower (160 kilowatts) and 229 pound-feet of torque. No details about a dual-motor AWD variant have been released, but it's difficult to imagine Kia wouldn't offer it later on.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the overseas version of the Kia EV5 may not feature an LFP battery; The Korean Car Blog previously reported that the EV5 would get an 82-kilowatt-hour NMC pack outside China, which would enable up to 373 miles of range.\\n\\nThe Kia EV5 will be produced in China by the Kia-Yueda joint venture at its plant in Yancheng. Vehicles made there will be sold in China and exported to some markets, as Kia-Yueda previously said the EV5 is its first China-made global EV.\\n\\nThe EV5 will officially debut on August 25 at the Chengdu Motor Show, but pre-sales will kick off in November.\\n\\nSource: MIIT via CarNewsChina\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"Kia's plug-in hybrids might offer 60 miles of electric range in a \\\"couple of years.\\\"\\n\\nThe statement comes from Steven Center, Kia America's chief operating officer and executive vice president.\\n\\nCurrent Kia PHEVs can deliver roughly 30 miles of electric range.\\n\\nBesides kicking things into high gear in the all-electric vehicle game, Kia also wants to increase its footprint in the plug-in hybrid vehicle market. Not only by offering more battery-assisted cars which are more fuel efficient if plugged in regularly, but also by upping the maximum range of these models while running on battery power.\\n\\nCurrently, Kia\\u2019s PHEVs can cover up to 34 miles on electricity with a full battery before kicking in the gas engine. This could be enough for drivers who only do short journeys and can recharge at home, but how would 60 miles of all-electric range sound?\\n\\nThat\\u2019s almost double the number available today. It would significantly open up the market to people who wouldn\\u2019t consider a battery-powered car otherwise. They could drive the car on electricity most of the time for the usual errands around town and then fill up the gas tank if a long trip is coming up.\\n\\nWith battery tech advancing at a rapid pace and new vehicle platforms designed to fit bigger battery packs for gas-powered cars, these 60-mile PHEVs might come in as little as \\u201ca couple of years,\\u201d according to Steven Center, Kia America\\u2019s chief operating officer and executive vice president, who spoke with Green Car Reports during the Los Angeles Auto Show.\\n\\nThe 60-mile figure came from an \\u201cengineering statistic,\\u201d Center said, and it relates to the total daily driving distance for Americans. According to data from mobility analytics platform Replica, people in the United States travel a nationwide average of 42 daily miles. This includes all forms of transportation, including personal vehicles, mass transit, biking and walking.\\n\\nThe 2025 Kia Sportage PHEV has an all-electric EPA-rated range of 34 miles.\\n\\nAt the same time, a study from the Maryland Transportation Institute and Center for Advanced Transportation Technology Laboratory at the University of Maryland showed that 52% of all trips made by Americans in 2021 were shorter than three miles and just 2% of trips were longer than 50 miles.

In most of 2022, monthly sales volume was consistently stuck at around 1.1 million units as low new-vehicle inventory levels squeezed sales. Inventory has improved notably, and new-vehicle sales are increasing. Inventory volume in Q1 was up by 70% compared to the same timeframe last year. And what do we know about higher inventory? It often leads to higher sales.\n","\n","Electric vehicle inventory—and choice—expanded notably in Q1 as well. A year ago, there were 34 electric vehicles to choose from. This year, the number jumped to 42, and choice is expected to expand further in every quarter of 2023. One note, the 42 count includes the GMC Hummer EV—2 were sold in March—and the Mazda MX-30, which is sold only in select markets and chalked up volume of 15 in Q1. Vinfast, a new player on the field, has also now been included.\n","\n","Counting all EVs, including Hummers and MX-30s, the Kelley Blue Book team estimates EV sales in Q1 increased by 44.9% year over year and reached 258,882, a record quarter for the U.S. market. With Q1 in the books, the U.S. market is on course for annual EV sales to surpass 1 million for the first time in 2023, as predicted by Cox Automotive analysts this past December.\n","\n","Tesla led the way in Q1, helped by sizeable price cuts. Tesla sales were up 24.6% year over year, and the EV pioneer continues to be both the industry’s top-selling luxury make and EV make by far. Tesla’s share of the EV market fell to 62.4%, down slightly from its full-year result in 2022—64.2%—and down significantly from the nearly 79% share Tesla commanded in 2020. Still, a 62% share of the EV market makes Tesla “the market.”\n","\n","Chevy Bolt sales in Q1 were strong, placing the bowtie brand a distant No. 2 in EV sales; Ford was third. And interestingly, despite solid, popular products from both Hyundai and Kia, EV sales from the brands decreased last quarter. On the luxury side, Audi, BMW and Mercedes all posted strong year-over-year sales growth thanks to excellent new offerings.\n","\n","New tax incentives pushed by the government are certainly spurring interest, and some confusion. But EVs continue to be the talk of the industry. Overall, the Cox Automotive team believes EV sales growth will outpace industry growth for the foreseeable future. EV share in Q1 hit 7.2% of new-vehicle sales, which is also a record. Many analysts talk about tipping points in the industry when volume quickly accelerates. Considering automaker investments and future product plans on the table, that tipping point may well be fast approaching, if not already here.\"\"\"},\n","    {\"date\": \"20230612\",\n","     \"title\": \"Electric Vehicle Sales in Q2 Strike Another Record, but Growth Ahead Will Be Hard Fought\",\n","     \"article\": \"\"\"Nearly 300,000 new electric vehicles (EVs) – full battery-electric vehicles – were sold in the U.S. in Q2, a record for any quarter and an increase of 48.4% from Q2 2022. Tesla, again, was the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., with more than 175,000 sold, an increase of 34.8% quarter over quarter. Sales growth at Tesla, and the EV segment overall, was aided by sizeable price cuts by some automakers (Tesla, really) and incentive levels well above the industry average. In June, the average price paid for an EV was down nearly 20% year over year. EV share of the U.S. market in Q2 was 7.2%, up from 5.7% a year ago and down from the high in Q1 of an upwardly revised 7.3%.\n","\n","Tesla is the No. 1 seller of luxury vehicles in the U.S., but its share of EV sales continues to fizzle. In Q2, Tesla’s share fell below 60% for the first time, but the No. 2 seller of EVs in the U.S. – Chevrolet – is a distant second. Tesla outsold Chevrolet 10 to 1 in Q2. Ford and Hyundai are third and fourth behind Chevrolet. Newcomer Rivian had a good quarter, with more than 20,000 units sold. Tesla’s success, in many ways, is the Model Y, the leading EV in America. One of every three EVs sold last quarter was a Tesla Model Y. Add in the similar-sized Model 3, and those two products are half the electric vehicle business. The once-leading Model S is no longer the best-selling high-end EV. Sales last quarter were estimated at 5,257, down more than 40% year over year and well behind the newcomer: BMW i4 EV sedan, with 6,777 sales in Q2, the new boss when it comes to super-lux EV sedans.\n","\n","EV sales growth and filling the gaps in infrastructure to support EV mobility continue to be the industry’s leading story. Cox Automotive expects the country to welcome 1 million new EVs to its roads in 2023, which will fuel the budding used EV market further. Sparked in part by government incentives, new battery production facilities are cropping up around the country, and factories are being retooled and rethought to support EV production. This fall, the United Auto Workers are negotiating their labor contracts with many automakers, and one topic is front and center: EVs. Even vehicle transportation and logistics – the trucking of EVs – is being redesigned in some part, as the current crop of EVs is heavier and harder to move than their ICE brethren.\n","\n","And EV sales keep growing.\n","\n","In a recent Cox Automotive survey, more than 50% of shoppers were interested in adding an EV to their stable. Being interested is easy, of course, but far fewer people actually buy. And in the same survey, 53% of consumers agreed that EVs will eventually replace traditional ICE-powered vehicles. Dealers were more cautious, with only 31% agreeing on an all-EV future. Dealers have a front-row seat to the many challenges ahead. And many dealers, recently, have been watching EV inventory building.\n","\n","In late June 2023, the days’ supply of EVs was over 100, whereas industry-wide inventory levels were closer to 53 days. When it comes to EV sales, the market is likely heading into its Trough of Disillusionment (hat tip to the Gartner Hype Cycle), where collaboration across many parties will be necessary to push through. Building EVs is one thing, and many in the industry are proving excellent at that skill. Selling EVs is something different altogether. Yes, EV sales records will continue to be set, and EV growth will continue to outpace overall industry growth, but the days of 75% year-over-year growth are in the rearview mirror. The hard-growth days are ahead.\"\"\"},\n","    {\"date\": \"20231012\",\n","     \"title\": \"Another Quarter, Another Record: EV Sales in the U.S. Surpass 300,000 in Q3, as Tesla Share of EV Segment Tumbles to 50%\",\n","     \"article\": \"\"\"Electric vehicle (EV) sales volumes set another record in Q3, as total sales of battery-powered vehicles jumped past 300,000 for the first time in the U.S. market. Year-to-date EV sales through September reached just over 873,000, putting the market firmly on track to surpass 1 million for the first time ever. The milestone will likely be achieved in November.\n","\n","Total EV sales in Q3, according to an estimate from Kelley Blue Book, hit 313,086, a 49.8% increase from the same period one year ago and an increase from the 298,039 sold in Q2. Most automakers posted sizeable gains over 2022, with Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes and Hyundai delivering increases above 200%, thanks mostly to new products entering the market. In Q3, 14 new EV models that did not exist one year ago were in the mix, including Chevrolet Blazer and Silverado EVs. (The new Chevy EVs had very low sales – just an initial few to mark a Q3 launch). The EV market is transforming, to be sure.\n","\n","Electric vehicle sales accounted for 7.9% of total industry sales in Q3, a record and up from 6.1% a year ago and 7.2% in Q2. As Cox Automotive has been reporting, higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the U.S. market. EV sales have now increased for 13 straight quarters.\n","\n","EV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped, as Tesla’s Q3 sales grew by 19.5% year over year, surpassing the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%. However, Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1. The long-promised Cybertruck may reverse the downward trend, although competition from Ford, Rivian and Chevrolet will likely impact Tesla’s electric pickup volume potential.\n","\n","The German luxury makes – Audi, BMW, and Mercedes – continue to rapidly increase sales of EV models. In Q3, BMW and Mercedes EV sales more than triple year-ago levels, while Audi posted an EV sales gain of 94%.\n","\n","Among automakers selling internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV products, Audi, BMW and Volvo had the richest mix of EVs in Q3. BMW had the highest proportion, with over 15% of its sales being EVs, followed by Audi and Volvo, with over 12% of their sales being EVs, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. Mercedes, Porsche and VW all had an EV mix in excess of 10% last quarter.\n","\n","Q3 EV SHARE OF TOTAL BRAND SALES\n","\n","In 2020, just three years back, EV sales in the U.S. passed 250,000 for the first time. This year, the market will jump past 1 million. In Q3, Tesla remains the undisputed leader in EV sales, with Ford a distant #2 on the list, selling just over 20,000 EVs.\n","\n","Most analysts expect a flood of new EVs in the coming three years, with the number of available EV products likely to double by 2027. With this changing landscape, EV sales volume growth in the U.S. is expected to continue. Of late, product availability has grown exponentially, while consumer acceptance has grown in a more linear fashion. Those trends will likely continue, making for some very interesting market dynamics in the years ahead. Change is never easy.\"\"\"},\n","    {\"date\": \"20240109\",\n","     \"title\": \"A Record 1.2 Million EVs Were Sold in the U.S. in 2023, According to Estimates from Kelley Blue Book\",\n","     \"article\": \"\"\"A record 1.2 million U.S. vehicle buyers chose to go electric last year, according to estimates from Kelley Blue Book, a Cox Automotive company. More specifically, 1,189,051 new electric vehicles (EVs) were put into service as the slow shift to an electrified future continued unabated. In 2023, the EV share of the total U.S. vehicle market was 7.6%, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. That is up from 5.9% in 2022.\n","\n","EV sales in the fourth quarter set a record for both volume and share: 317,168 and 8.1%, respectively. And while records were set, the oft-reported slowdown is real. Q4 EV sales increased year over year by 40% – a strong result by any measure, except when compared to the growth the industry saw in previous quarters. The market posted a 49% gain in Q3, and EV sales were up 52% year over year in Q4 2022. By volume, EV sales in Q4 were higher than in Q3 by roughly 5,000 units. The EV market in the U.S. is still growing, but not growing as fast.\n","\n","The Cox Automotive Economic and Industry Insights team is calling 2024 “the Year of More” when it comes to EVs. More new product, more incentives, more inventory, more leasing, more infrastructure – all the more will combine to push EV sales higher in the year ahead. The team forecasts EV share of the U.S. market in 2024 will reach 10%.\n","\n","According to December transaction price data shared during the Cox Automotive Industry Insights Webcast early in January, transaction price parity between internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs looks more realistic in the coming years. Still, EVs remain expensive. Last month, the average price paid for a new EV was $50,789, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. Shifts in tax incentives will both help and hurt buyers in the year ahead – fewer vehicles now qualify, but the ability for dealers to apply any tax credits at the point of sale will help. Generally speaking, shoppers are still hard-pressed to find a new EV with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price below $40,000. In fact, there were two last month: The Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf.\n","\n","Tesla remains the undisputed champion of EV sales in the U.S., capturing 55% of the EV market in 2023. That’s down from 65% in 2022, but lower prices are clearly fortifying the company’s position. Tesla’s share increased in Q4 after falling to an all-time low in Q3. Notably, the Model Y accounted for 33% of all EVs sold in 2023. Tesla’s share of the total U.S. market reached an all-time high of 4.20% in calendar year 2023, a number that was not lost on Tesla boss Elon Musk and his humor. Tesla outsold VW, Subaru and others in 2023.\n","\n","The German luxury brands have all lost share to Tesla over the past five years, but new products are certainly attracting luxury EV buyers back to the traditional Bavarian nameplates. Last year, 12.5% of BMW sales were EVs. Audi and Mercedes also increased their EV sales, which now account for 11% and 11.5% of total brand sales, respectively. Nearly all automakers should see their share of EV sales increase in the year ahead, and those not currently in the game will jump in.\n","\n","Still, in the automobile business, nothing happens quickly. EV growth will continue to slow, and in the year ahead, we may even report the first quarter-over-quarter sales decline in more than three years. Regardless, the Cox Automotive Industry Insights team is forecasting more growth in the EV market. The momentum is there and is not going away.\"\"\"},\n","    {\"date\": \"20240411\",\n","     \"title\": \"EV Sales Growth Slows; Market Leader Tesla Stalls\",\n","     \"article\": \"\"\"Electric vehicle (EV) sales growth in the U.S. continues to slow, according to sales data analyzed by Kelley Blue Book. In the first quarter of 2024, Americans bought 268,909 new electric vehicles, according to Kelley Blue Book counts. EV share of total new-vehicle sales in Q1 was 7.3%, a decrease from Q4 2023.\n","\n","While annual EV sales continue to grow in the U.S. market, the growth rate has slowed notably. Sales in Q1 rose 2.6% year over year, but fell 15.2% compared to Q4 2023. The increase last quarter was well below the previous two years.\n","\n","In Q1 2023, EV sales volumes were up 46.4% year over year and 15.5% quarter over quarter. In Q1 2022, EV sales were higher by 81.2% year over year and 20.4% higher than the previous quarter.\n","\n","“Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. declined during Q1 2024 – the first quarter-over-quarter downturn since Q2 2020,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive.\n","\n","“As anticipated, Tesla’s sales took a hit, influencing the overall market dynamics. However, a few brands saw significant EV sales increases, achieving over 50% year-over-year growth. As noted in January, we are calling 2024, ‘the Year of More’. More new products, more incentives, more inventory, more leasing and more infrastructure will drive EV sales higher this year. Even so, we’ll continue to see ups and downs as the industry moves towards electrification.”\n","\n","Analysts at Cox Automotive had expected a slowdown in EV sales growth. Segment growth typically slows as volume increases. This is certainly true with the market leader Tesla, which reported notably lower global deliveries in Q1 2024.\n","\n","According to Kelley Blue Book estimates, Tesla sales in the U.S. were down 13.3% year over year – well below the typical double-digit growth that had become routine with the Tesla brand. Tesla’s share of the electric vehicle market in Q1 2024 was 51.3%, down from 61.7% one year earlier.\n","\n","Though the overall year-over-year growth was minimal in Q1, nine manufacturers recorded more than 50% year-over-year growth in EV sales – BMW, Cadillac, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Lexus, Mercedes, Rivian and Vinfast.\n","\n","Notably, lower prices have supported EV sales volume in the U.S., particularly for key Tesla models. The average transaction price for a new EV in Q1 was $55,167, a 9.0% decrease compared to Q1 2023 and down 3.8% quarter over quarter. Tesla’s average transaction price was $52,315 in Q1, down roughly 13.5% year over year. However, lower prices did not generate higher volume.\n","\n","Many automakers have followed Tesla’s lead and slashed prices. Incentive spending on EVs has increased notably in the past year, another sign of slowing demand. Leasing, too, has increased. In Q1, roughly 27% of all EVs were leased, more than double from the year before. With leasing, many buyers can qualify for the full $7,500 incentive the Inflation Reduction Act offers.\n","\n","One bright spot in Q1: Strong EV sales from luxury makers, suggesting the EV market continues to be luxury-driven. Cadillac achieved a 499.2% year-over-year increase in electric vehicle sales due to robust sales of its Lyriq model. At Mercedes, EV sales were up 66.9%. BMW posted a 62.6% increase in EV sales compared to Q1 2023. At Audi, Q1 EV sales grew 28.8% year over year.\n","\n","Meanwhile, sales of the most affordable EV in the U.S. – the Chevy Bolt – have been temporarily halted. Bolt sales fell 64.3% year over year in Q1, hitting just 7,040, as production stopped. A new version of the Bolt is expected to launch in 2025. On the non-luxury side, Ford achieved an 86.1% year-over-year increase in Q1 EV sales with the second-highest EV sales volume behind Tesla.\n","\n","Cox Automotive forecasts EV sales in the U.S. to increase year over year in 2024, making this year the best year ever for EV sales. Analysts expect EV sales to reach roughly 10% of the market by the end of the year, up from 7.3% in the first quarter.\"\"\"},\n","    {\"date\": \"20240611\",\n","     \"title\": \"Despite Tesla Slide, EV Sales in Q2 Mark New Record\",\n","     \"article\": \"\"\"Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. grew by 11.3% year over year in the second quarter, reaching a record-high volume of 330,4631 units, according to new estimates from Kelley Blue Book. This growth was driven partly by improved availability, higher discounts and elevated levels of leasing. Total EV sales last quarter were higher than Q1 sales by 23% percent. In Q2, market leader Tesla sales volume declined by 6.3% year over year, but new products, notably from General Motors, helped lift overall volume higher. In the second quarter, Tesla’s share of EV sales fell below 50% for the first time in the U.S. to 49.7%.\n","\n","The sales estimates from Kelley Blue Book show that electric vehicles accounted for approximately 8% of total new-vehicle sales in the second quarter, higher than the 7.1% share in the first quarter of the year and higher than the 7.2% recorded in Q2 last year.\n","\n","Cox Automotive Industry Insights Director Stephanie Valdez Streaty commented: “EV sales exceeded expectations during a record-breaking quarter. Despite Tesla’s declining sales, with its EV sales share now below 50% for the first time, the overall competitive landscape for electric vehicles is intensifying. This increased competition is leading to continued price pressure, gradually boosting EV adoption. Automakers that deliver the right product at the right price and offer an excellent consumer experience will lead the way in EV adoption.”\n","\n","While Tesla remains the dominant player in the EV segment, new electric offerings by mainstream competitors – and more aggressive pricing – continue to provide shoppers with interesting alternatives. Notable new entries in Q2 include the BMW i5, Cadillac Lyriq, Honda Prologue, and Kia EV9 SUV. Higher volumes of the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning helped the Ford brand retain its No. 2 position, behind Tesla, in the EV market.\n","\n","New EVs from General Motors are also helping grow industry volume. In Q2, GM added more than 21,000 EVs to the market. New models include electric versions of the Chevy Blazer, Equinox and Silverado, which tallied more than 10,000 sales in Q2, although the extra volume was not enough to offset the discontinued Chevy Bolt. In Q2, Chevrolet’s EV sales were lower by 19% year over year.  Other major players who lost ground year over year in Q2 include Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Porsche, Volvo and VW.\n","\n","Added Valdez Streaty, “We remain bullish on electric vehicle sales in the long term. The growth will, at times, be very slow, as all-time horizons in the automobile business are vast, but the long-term trajectory suggests that higher volumes of EVs will continue over time. As EV infrastructure and technology improve, and more models are launched, many shoppers sitting on the fence will eventually choose an EV.”\"\"\"},\n","    {\"date\": \"20241011\",\n","     \"title\": \"Electric Vehicle Sales Mark Another Record in Q3, Thanks to Higher Incentives, More Choices\",\n","     \"article\": \"\"\"According to new estimates from Kelley Blue Book, electric vehicle (EV) sales in the U.S. grew by 11% year over year in the third quarter and reached record highs for both volume and market share.

The EV share of sales in Q3 hit 8.9%, the highest level recorded and an increase from 7.8% in Q3 2023.\n","\n","“While year-over-year growth has slowed, EV sales in the U.S. continue to march higher,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive. “The growth is being fueled in part by Incentives and discounts; but as more affordable EVs enter the market and infrastructure improves, we can expect even greater adoption in the coming years.”\n","\n","Electric vehicle incentives and discounts were elevated in Q3, which helped fuel higher sales. In Q3, incentives averaged more than 12% of the average transaction price (ATP), much higher than the industry-wide average of approximately 7%.\n","\n","The “leasing loophole” was also generously applied, as leasing allows all EV buyers to qualify for generous government-supported incentives. Electric vehicle prices were higher year over year in Q3 but by less than 1%. The average price paid for an EV in Q3 was just over $57,000, a premium of approximately 19% compared to the industry-wide ATP of just over $48,000.\n","\n","After seeing sales fall year over year in the first half, market leader Tesla returned to growth mode in Q3, with sales up 6.6%, thanks mostly to the newly introduced Cybertruck. Despite a six-figure price tag – average transaction price in September was north of $116,000, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates – more than 16,000 Cybertrucks were sold in Q3. In fact, Cybertruck outsold every other available EV except for two – Tesla’s popular Model Y and Model 3.\n","\n","General Motors EV sales jumped significantly in Q3, up nearly 60% to 32,095. While still a distant second to market leader Tesla, GM improved its standing in the EV race thanks to strong sales from three of its four core brands – Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. Hyundai Motor Group fell behind GM and into third place, with sales generally flat year over year at 29,609. Ford was fourth in sales with 23,509, and Honda and Acura contributed more than 15,000 EV sales in the quarter, thanks to two new models.

In most of 2022, monthly sales volume was consistently stuck at around 1.1 million units as low new-vehicle inventory levels squeezed sales. Inventory has improved notably, and new-vehicle sales are increasing. Inventory volume in Q1 was up by 70% compared to the same timeframe last year. And what do we know about higher inventory? It often leads to higher sales. \\n\\nElectric vehicle inventory\\u2014and choice\\u2014expanded notably in Q1 as well. A year ago, there were 34 electric vehicles to choose from. This year, the number jumped to 42, and choice is expected to expand further in every quarter of 2023. One note, the 42 count includes the GMC Hummer EV\\u20142 were sold in March\\u2014and the Mazda MX-30, which is sold only in select markets and chalked up volume of 15 in Q1. Vinfast, a new player on the field, has also now been included. \\n\\nCounting all EVs, including Hummers and MX-30s, the Kelley Blue Book team estimates EV sales in Q1 increased by 44.9% year over year and reached 258,882, a record quarter for the U.S. market. With Q1 in the books, the U.S. market is on course for annual EV sales to surpass 1 million for the first time in 2023, as predicted by Cox Automotive analysts this past December.  \\n\\nTesla led the way in Q1, helped by sizeable price cuts. Tesla sales were up 24.6% year over year, and the EV pioneer continues to be both the industry\\u2019s top-selling luxury make and EV make by far. Tesla\\u2019s share of the EV market fell to 62.4%, down slightly from its full-year result in 2022\\u201464.2%\\u2014and down significantly from the nearly 79% share Tesla commanded in 2020. Still, a 62% share of the EV market makes Tesla \\u201cthe market.\\u201d\\n\\nChevy Bolt sales in Q1 were strong, placing the bowtie brand a distant No. 2 in EV sales; Ford was third. And interestingly, despite solid, popular products from both Hyundai and Kia, EV sales from the brands decreased last quarter. On the luxury side, Audi, BMW and Mercedes all posted strong year-over-year sales growth thanks to excellent new offerings. \\n\\nNew tax incentives pushed by the government are certainly spurring interest, and some confusion. But EVs continue to be the talk of the industry. Overall, the Cox Automotive team believes EV sales growth will outpace industry growth for the foreseeable future. EV share in Q1 hit 7.2% of new-vehicle sales, which is also a record. Many analysts talk about tipping points in the industry when volume quickly accelerates. Considering automaker investments and future product plans on the table, that tipping point may well be fast approaching, if not already here.\",\n          \"Nearly 300,000 new electric vehicles (EVs) \\u2013 full battery-electric vehicles \\u2013 were sold in the U.S. in Q2, a record for any quarter and an increase of 48.4% from Q2 2022. Tesla, again, was the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., with more than 175,000 sold, an increase of 34.8% quarter over quarter. Sales growth at Tesla, and the EV segment overall, was aided by sizeable price cuts by some automakers (Tesla, really) and incentive levels well above the industry average. In June, the average price paid for an EV was down nearly 20% year over year. EV share of the U.S. market in Q2 was 7.2%, up from 5.7% a year ago and down from the high in Q1 of an upwardly revised 7.3%.\\n\\nTesla is the No. 1 seller of luxury vehicles in the U.S., but its share of EV sales continues to fizzle. In Q2, Tesla\\u2019s share fell below 60% for the first time, but the No. 2 seller of EVs in the U.S. \\u2013 Chevrolet \\u2013 is a distant second. Tesla outsold Chevrolet 10 to 1 in Q2. Ford and Hyundai are third and fourth behind Chevrolet. Newcomer Rivian had a good quarter, with more than 20,000 units sold. Tesla\\u2019s success, in many ways, is the Model Y, the leading EV in America. One of every three EVs sold last quarter was a Tesla Model Y. Add in the similar-sized Model 3, and those two products are half the electric vehicle business. The once-leading Model S is no longer the best-selling high-end EV. Sales last quarter were estimated at 5,257, down more than 40% year over year and well behind the newcomer: BMW i4 EV sedan, with 6,777 sales in Q2, the new boss when it comes to super-lux EV sedans.\\n\\nEV sales growth and filling the gaps in infrastructure to support EV mobility continue to be the industry\\u2019s leading story. Cox Automotive expects the country to welcome 1 million new EVs to its roads in 2023, which will fuel the budding used EV market further. Sparked in part by government incentives, new battery production facilities are cropping up around the country, and factories are being retooled and rethought to support EV production. This fall, the United Auto Workers are negotiating their labor contracts with many automakers, and one topic is front and center: EVs. Even vehicle transportation and logistics \\u2013 the trucking of EVs \\u2013 is being redesigned in some part, as the current crop of EVs is heavier and harder to move than their ICE brethren.\\n\\nAnd EV sales keep growing.\\n\\nIn a recent Cox Automotive survey, more than 50% of shoppers were interested in adding an EV to their stable. Being interested is easy, of course, but far fewer people actually buy. And in the same survey, 53% of consumers agreed that EVs will eventually replace traditional ICE-powered vehicles. Dealers were more cautious, with only 31% agreeing on an all-EV future. Dealers have a front-row seat to the many challenges ahead. And many dealers, recently, have been watching EV inventory building.\\n\\nIn late June 2023, the days\\u2019 supply of EVs was over 100, whereas industry-wide inventory levels were closer to 53 days. When it comes to EV sales, the market is likely heading into its Trough of Disillusionment (hat tip to the Gartner Hype Cycle), where collaboration across many parties will be necessary to push through. Building EVs is one thing, and many in the industry are proving excellent at that skill. Selling EVs is something different altogether. Yes, EV sales records will continue to be set, and EV growth will continue to outpace overall industry growth, but the days of 75% year-over-year growth are in the rearview mirror. The hard-growth days are ahead.\",\n          \"Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. grew by 11.3% year over year in the second quarter, reaching a record-high volume of 330,4631 units, according to new estimates from Kelley Blue Book. This growth was driven partly by improved availability, higher discounts and elevated levels of leasing. Total EV sales last quarter were higher than Q1 sales by 23% percent. In Q2, market leader Tesla sales volume declined by 6.3% year over year, but new products, notably from General Motors, helped lift overall volume higher. In the second quarter, Tesla\\u2019s share of EV sales fell below 50% for the first time in the U.S. to 49.7%.\\n\\nThe sales estimates from Kelley Blue Book show that electric vehicles accounted for approximately 8% of total new-vehicle sales in the second quarter, higher than the 7.1% share in the first quarter of the year and higher than the 7.2% recorded in Q2 last year.\\n\\nCox Automotive Industry Insights Director Stephanie Valdez Streaty commented: \\u201cEV sales exceeded expectations during a record-breaking quarter. Despite Tesla\\u2019s declining sales, with its EV sales share now below 50% for the first time, the overall competitive landscape for electric vehicles is intensifying. This increased competition is leading to continued price pressure, gradually boosting EV adoption. Automakers that deliver the right product at the right price and offer an excellent consumer experience will lead the way in EV adoption.\\u201d\\n\\nWhile Tesla remains the dominant player in the EV segment, new electric offerings by mainstream competitors \\u2013 and more aggressive pricing \\u2013 continue to provide shoppers with interesting alternatives. Notable new entries in Q2 include the BMW i5, Cadillac Lyriq, Honda Prologue, and Kia EV9 SUV. Higher volumes of the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning helped the Ford brand retain its No. 2 position, behind Tesla, in the EV market.  \\n\\nNew EVs from General Motors are also helping grow industry volume. In Q2, GM added more than 21,000 EVs to the market. New models include electric versions of the Chevy Blazer, Equinox and Silverado, which tallied more than 10,000 sales in Q2, although the extra volume was not enough to offset the discontinued Chevy Bolt. In Q2, Chevrolet\\u2019s EV sales were lower by 19% year over year.  Other major players who lost ground year over year in Q2 include Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Porsche, Volvo and VW.\\n\\nAdded Valdez Streaty, \\u201cWe remain bullish on electric vehicle sales in the long term. The growth will, at times, be very slow, as all-time horizons in the automobile business are vast, but the long-term trajectory suggests that higher volumes of EVs will continue over time. As EV infrastructure and technology improve, and more models are launched, many shoppers sitting on the fence will eventually choose an EV.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 2.

But with 1.33 billion light vehicles currently on the road, EV-volumes forecasts that by the end of 2030, electric vehicles will only account for 15% of the global parc, assuming normal scrappage rates.\n","\n","This will increase to nearly 30% by the end of 2035, with EVs only accounting for half of all operational light vehicles by 2042.\"\"\"},\n","     {\"date\": \"20230817\",\n","     \"title\": \"Global EV Sales for 2023 H1\",\n","     \"article\": \"\"\"Global EV sales continue strong. A total of 6 million new Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrids (PHEV) were delivered during the first half of 2023, an increase of +40 %. 4,27 million were pure electric BEVs and 1,76 million were PHEVs. Preliminary July results show +40 % growth again. The regional growth pattern has shifted: China EV sales increased by +37 % in 2023 H1 y/y, compared to +82 % in 2022 vs 2021. Sales in Western and Central Europe were up +28 % in H1 compared to just +15 % growth in 2022. EV sales in USA and Canada are +50 % higher YTD to June than last year.  EV sales outside the aforementioned markets increased by 102 %, albeit from a low base.  Overall vehicle markets saw a considerable recovery, with +17 % y/y growth in Europe in H1 but weaker and more volatile in China. The global light vehicle market was 11 % higher in 2023 H1 than in 2022 H1 but still trailed the 2015-2019 average by five million units on an annualized basis.EV shares continued to climb in all markets. BEVs (10 %) and PHEVs (4,1 %) stood for 14,1 % of global light vehicle sales at the close of H1, compared to 11,3 % in 2022 H1. Norway had the highest market share of EVs in H1 (BEVs 75 % + PHEVs 6 %), China had 30,5 %, Europe 19,7 % and USA 8,7 %. The fastest growing markets were Indonesia with 6000 BEV & PHEV units for H1, +886 %, Thailand with 39 500 units, up +370 %, Turkey with 12 300 units, up +326 % and Australia with 47 400 units, up +248 %.\n","\n","PHEVs stood for 29,6 % in the BEV-PHEV mix in 2023 H1 compared to 27,2 % in 2022. The PHEV volume increase was 891 000 units in H1, most of it (754k) in China. High sales of BYD PHEVs and the renaissance of Range Extender Electric Vehicles (EREVs) are the main reason.  Also, mini-EVs like the Wuling Hongguang found fewer buyers in a tougher economic environment. As they are all BEVs their decline is dragging down the BEV share within China’s New Energy Vehicle (NEV) volume.\n","\n","BYD nearly doubled H1 sales to 1,25 millionb units, making it #1 in the global EV sales ranking, with their 633 000 PHEV sales included. Counting BEVs only, Tesla still leads by a wide margin with 889 000 units delivered in H1.For the full year of 2023, we expect sales of 14 million EVs, growth of +33 % over 2022, with BEVs reaching 10 million units and PHEVs 4 million units. By the end of 2023 we expect 40 million EVs in operation, counting light vehicles, 70 % of which are BEVs and 30 % PHEVs. Sales of Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCEV) in the light vehicle sector have declined by -25 % so far this year and remain below 20 000 units annually. Current sales are from five vehicle models and most sales are in South Korea and USA. We estimate their current population to be about 60 000 units.\"\"\"},\n","     {\"date\": \"20230206\",\n","     \"title\": \"Global EV Sales for 2022\",\n","     \"article\": \"\"\"Global EV sales continued strong. A total of 10,5 million new BEVs and PHEVs were delivered during 2022, an increase of +55 % compared to 2021. The regional growth pattern is shifting, though. Following 2 years of steep sales increases in Europe, EVs gained only +15 % over 2021 there. Weak overall vehicle markets and persistent component shortages have taken their toll, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. EV sales in USA and Canada increased by 48 % year-on-year, despite a weak overall light vehicle market which plunged by 8 % during 2022 y/y. The 2nd half of 2022 saw a cautious recovery of auto markets as numbers compared to the low results of 2021 H1. Global light vehicle sales for 2022, 81 million units, were still -0,5 % lower than in 2021 and -15 % below pre-2020 levels.\n","\n","China NEV sales defied all headwinds the country faced otherwise (real estate crisis, Covid outbreaks and lock-downs) and increased by another +82 % year-on-year. BYD more than tripled sales to 1,85 million units, making it the #1 in the global sales ranking, if their 944 500 PHEV sales are included. Counting BEVs only, Tesla still leads by a wide margin with 1,31 million units delivered in 2022.\n","\n","PHEVs stood for 27 % of global Plug-in sales in 2022 compared to 29 % in 2021. While their sales volumes still increased, their share in the PEV mix is in decline, facing headwinds from incentive cuts and improving BEV offers. Sales growth is increasingly depending on the degree of electrification. While BEVs grew by +59 % and PHEVs by +46 %, non-chargeable Full Hybrids grew by +15 % and Mild Hybrids by +1 % y-o-y. Global sales of vehicles which can be charged from the grid (10,5 m) were higher than for non-chargeable vehicles (8,4 m) for the first time in 2022. ICE-only vehicle sales declined by -7 %; their share in global light vehicle sales is 76,8 %, compared to 82,2 % in 2021. FCEV remain irrelevant for the electrification of light vehicles; their deliveries stagnated at 15 400 units in 2022, which is 0,02 % of the global, annual light vehicle volume.\n","\n","Rapid EV adoption in weak auto markets has boosted EV shares further. BEVs (9,5 %) and PHEVs (3,5 %) stood for 13 % of global light vehicle sales in 2022, compared to 8,3 % in 2021. Norway had the highest market share of EVs in H1 (BEV 71 % + PHEV 8 %), China had 27 %, Europe 20,8 % and USA 7,2 %. The fastest growing markets were Indonesia (from 1k to 10k), India with +223 % to 50k, nearly all BEVs, New Zealand +151 % to 23k for 20 % market share. EV supply and adoption is now spreading rapidly into the global south. November and December of 2022 saw demand distortions by coming reductions of EV grants in Europe and China and the IRA in the US for 2023. Demand for EVs and ICEs alike were pulled into 2022 or pushed into 2023. We expect irregular EV sales and shares in several countries for Q1 of 2023. For the full year of 2023, we expect sales of 14,3 million EVs, a growth of 36 % over 2022, with BEVs reaching 8 million units and PHEVs 2,6 million units. By the end of 2023 we expect nearly 40 million EVs in operation, counting light vehicles, 73 % are BEVs and 27 % PHEVs.\"\"\"}\n","\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"NBNBEciPs7aH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df2 = pd.DataFrame(data2)"],"metadata":{"id":"CvgUt8VmVAQz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df2"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":582},"id":"O0KGLntCVCtJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732780208945,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":338,"user":{"displayName":"채형김","userId":"13447971630655102369"}},"outputId":"4371cc95-0959-406d-eae7-6335cdb94cb7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        date                                              title  \\\n","0   20241118  On song BYD dominates record-breaking Chinese ...   \n","1   20241002  Is Europe’s EV decline impacting market foreca...   \n","2   20240919  Which EV manufacturers performed the best in 2...   \n","3   20240905              Is the global EV market slowing down?   \n","4   20240819  How have global EV forecasts reacted to strong...   \n","5   20240725  How is Europe’s EV slowdown affecting its mark...   \n","6   20240718  Europe’s medium and heavy-duty truck markets c...   \n","7   20240613          How popular are electric buses in Europe?   \n","8   20240527  Global EV growth forecast in 2024, but challen...   \n","9   20240422     Tesla dominates European EV market in February   \n","10  20240327  Growth forecast for European EV market despite...   \n","11  20240219    What was the most popular EV worldwide in 2023?   \n","12  20240122                           Global EV Sales for 2023   \n","13  20241214  The green transition of electric trucks and buses   \n","14  20231121  EVs Forecast to Account for Two Thirds of Glob...   \n","15  20230817                        Global EV Sales for 2023 H1   \n","16  20230206                           Global EV Sales for 2022   \n","\n","                                              article  \n","0   Chinese electric vehicle (EV) deliveries soare...  \n","1   With Europe’s light vehicle market slowing, ho...  \n","2   \"Which electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers sto...  \n","3   New electric vehicle (EV) sales across the wor...  \n","4   Global electric vehicle (EV) sales are experie...  \n","5   Europe’s electric vehicle (EV) market has slow...  \n","6   The electrification of Europe’s medium and hea...  \n","7   Europe’s electric-bus market ended 2023 on a h...  \n","8   Despite current market conditions leading to a...  \n","9   Electric vehicle (EV) registrations in Europe ...  \n","10  Even with incentive changes, Europe’s new elec...  \n","11  The global electric vehicle (EV) market broke ...  \n","12  Global EV sales continued as expected by us at...  \n","13  As electric vehicles (EVs) begin to make serio...  \n","14  We forecast that global EV sales, comprising b...  \n","15  Global EV sales continue strong.

Jos\\u00e9 Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, looks into the figures with Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry.\\n\\nRegistrations of EVs, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) set a new record in China in September. More than 1.1 million units were delivered in the month, a 51% increase year on year. This is even more spectacular when considering the overall market improvement in the month was just 5%.\\n\\nGrowth came from both powertrain types. BEVs were up 29% in September, to around 644,000 units, while PHEVs jumped 97% to around 479,000 units. This was the fourth month in a row that PHEVs broke their volume record.\\n\\nSeptember\\u2019s strong results saw EVs take a 53% share of the overall Chinese new-car market. BEVs alone accounted for 31% of all deliveries. In terms of EV share, BEVs held 57% of registrations in the month, while PHEVs had 32%. The remaining 11%  share was captured by extended-range models (EREVs).\\n\\nIn the first nine months of 2024, around 7.3 million EVs have been delivered to customers, a significant rise over the 5.4 million units that were registered in the same period during 2023.\\n\\nLooking at the market share between January and September, EVs held 47%, with 27% of this belonging to BEVs. Compared with 12 months prior, the 2023 plug-in share was 37%, with BEVs making up 25% overall. This means that while BEVs have only improved market share by two percentage points (pp), PHEVs are growing faster. The technology\\u2019s share increased by around 8pp year on year.\\n\\nWith this growth, the year should end with EVs holding around 50% of the market. This means the push for full electrification by around 2030 is still heading in the right direction.\",\n          \"With Europe\\u2019s light vehicle market slowing, how have electric vehicle (EV) forecasts been affected? Neil King, head of forecasting at EV Volumes, presents the latest outlook with Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry.\\n\\nEurope\\u2019s light-vehicle market, made up of passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (LCVs), has experienced a rollercoaster ride this year. Major markets across the continent enjoyed relatively consistent growth following the end of the supply-chain crisis in August 2022.\\n\\nHowever, this year has seen instability, with strong overall increases offset by large declines. With high interest rates and the cost-of-living crisis, the automotive market is in a state of flux.\\n\\nEV Volumes has reduced its forecast for Europe\\u2019s light-vehicle market in 2024. It now expects growth of 2.4% across the continent by the end of the year, down from the 2.6% forecast in June 2024.\\n\\nAt almost 15.1 million units, this falls far short of the 18 million light vehicles registered in Europe in 2019. Moreover, EV Volumes does not see the European market returning to this level during the current forecast horizon, up to 2035.\",\n          \"Europe\\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) market has slowed in the first half of 2024. But how will it affect the market this year and beyond? Neil King, head of forecasting at EV Volumes, presents the latest forecast with Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry.\\n\\nEurope\\u2019s new light-vehicle market, made up of passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (LCVs) is undergoing a difficult year in 2024, following its bounce back from various challenges last year.\\n\\nThe passenger-car market has seen slow growth, with declines in March and May, while the LCV market is currently performing well, but offers smaller volumes into the new light-vehicle sector.\\n\\nThe latest figures are compared to a period, however, where volumes increased rapidly, following the impact of a supply-chain crisis in 2021 and 2022. This was exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, and the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nYet, the market this year is more subdued, due to high interest rates and the continuing cost-of-living crisis.\\n\\nWith this in mind, EV Volumes has revised its forecasts from March 2024. The European new light-vehicle market is now expected to grow by 2.6% this year, a lower figure than the 3.1% improvement forecast earlier this year.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":32}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# urls2 = [\"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/byd-dominates-record-breaking-chinese-ev-market-in-september/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/is-europes-ev-decline-impacting-market-forecasts/\",\n","#          \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/which-ev-manufacturers-performed-the-best-in-2024-so-far/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/is-the-global-ev-market-slowing-down/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/how-have-global-ev-forecasts-reacted-to-strong-headwinds/\",\n","#          \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/how-is-europes-ev-slowdown-affecting-its-market-forecast/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/europes-truck-markets-continue-to-electrify/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/how-popular-are-electric-buses-in-europe/\",\n","#          \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/global-ev-growth-forecast-in-2024-but-challenges-remain/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/tesla-dominates-european-ev-market-in-february/\",\n","#          \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/growth-forecast-for-european-ev-market-despite-incentive-impact/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/what-was-the-most-popular-ev-worldwide-in-2023/\",\n","#          \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/global-ev-sales-for-2023/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/the-green-transition-of-electric-trucks-and-buses/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/evs-forecast-to-account-for-two-thirds-of-global-light-vehicle-sales-in-2035/\",\n","#          \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/global-ev-sales-for-2023-h1/\", \"https://ev-volumes.com/news/ev/global-ev-sales-for-2022/\"]"],"metadata":{"id":"iDSEzL2vs7Qv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# article_lst=[]\n","\n","# for url in urls2:\n","#   article = Article(url)\n","#   article.download()\n","#   article.parse()\n","#   article_lst.append(article.text)"],"metadata":{"id":"Xwlf416gszGi"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# df2['article'] = article"],"metadata":{"id":"75Vj_HrotbWl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# df2"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":582},"id":"P6gCaUgVvlNv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732780123621,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"채형김","userId":"13447971630655102369"}},"outputId":"b952a28b-b0e7-49bf-a34b-73836d2c8565"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        date                                              title  \\\n","0   20241118  On song BYD dominates record-breaking Chinese ...   \n","1   20241002  Is Europe’s EV decline impacting market foreca...   \n","2   20240919  Which EV manufacturers performed the best in 2...   \n","3   20240905              Is the global EV market slowing down?

In most of 2022, monthly sales volume was consistently stuck at around 1.1 million units as low new-vehicle inventory levels squeezed sales. Inventory has improved notably, and new-vehicle sales are increasing. Inventory volume in Q1 was up by 70% compared to the same timeframe last year. And what do we know about higher inventory? It often leads to higher sales. \\n\\nElectric vehicle inventory\\u2014and choice\\u2014expanded notably in Q1 as well. A year ago, there were 34 electric vehicles to choose from. This year, the number jumped to 42, and choice is expected to expand further in every quarter of 2023. One note, the 42 count includes the GMC Hummer EV\\u20142 were sold in March\\u2014and the Mazda MX-30, which is sold only in select markets and chalked up volume of 15 in Q1. Vinfast, a new player on the field, has also now been included. \\n\\nCounting all EVs, including Hummers and MX-30s, the Kelley Blue Book team estimates EV sales in Q1 increased by 44.9% year over year and reached 258,882, a record quarter for the U.S. market. With Q1 in the books, the U.S. market is on course for annual EV sales to surpass 1 million for the first time in 2023, as predicted by Cox Automotive analysts this past December.  \\n\\nTesla led the way in Q1, helped by sizeable price cuts. Tesla sales were up 24.6% year over year, and the EV pioneer continues to be both the industry\\u2019s top-selling luxury make and EV make by far. Tesla\\u2019s share of the EV market fell to 62.4%, down slightly from its full-year result in 2022\\u201464.2%\\u2014and down significantly from the nearly 79% share Tesla commanded in 2020. Still, a 62% share of the EV market makes Tesla \\u201cthe market.\\u201d\\n\\nChevy Bolt sales in Q1 were strong, placing the bowtie brand a distant No. 2 in EV sales; Ford was third. And interestingly, despite solid, popular products from both Hyundai and Kia, EV sales from the brands decreased last quarter. On the luxury side, Audi, BMW and Mercedes all posted strong year-over-year sales growth thanks to excellent new offerings. \\n\\nNew tax incentives pushed by the government are certainly spurring interest, and some confusion. But EVs continue to be the talk of the industry. Overall, the Cox Automotive team believes EV sales growth will outpace industry growth for the foreseeable future. EV share in Q1 hit 7.2% of new-vehicle sales, which is also a record. Many analysts talk about tipping points in the industry when volume quickly accelerates. Considering automaker investments and future product plans on the table, that tipping point may well be fast approaching, if not already here.\",\n          \"Nearly 300,000 new electric vehicles (EVs) \\u2013 full battery-electric vehicles \\u2013 were sold in the U.S. in Q2, a record for any quarter and an increase of 48.4% from Q2 2022. Tesla, again, was the largest seller of EVs in the U.S., with more than 175,000 sold, an increase of 34.8% quarter over quarter. Sales growth at Tesla, and the EV segment overall, was aided by sizeable price cuts by some automakers (Tesla, really) and incentive levels well above the industry average. In June, the average price paid for an EV was down nearly 20% year over year. EV share of the U.S. market in Q2 was 7.2%, up from 5.7% a year ago and down from the high in Q1 of an upwardly revised 7.3%.\\n\\nTesla is the No. 1 seller of luxury vehicles in the U.S., but its share of EV sales continues to fizzle. In Q2, Tesla\\u2019s share fell below 60% for the first time, but the No. 2 seller of EVs in the U.S. \\u2013 Chevrolet \\u2013 is a distant second. Tesla outsold Chevrolet 10 to 1 in Q2. Ford and Hyundai are third and fourth behind Chevrolet. Newcomer Rivian had a good quarter, with more than 20,000 units sold. Tesla\\u2019s success, in many ways, is the Model Y, the leading EV in America. One of every three EVs sold last quarter was a Tesla Model Y. Add in the similar-sized Model 3, and those two products are half the electric vehicle business. The once-leading Model S is no longer the best-selling high-end EV. Sales last quarter were estimated at 5,257, down more than 40% year over year and well behind the newcomer: BMW i4 EV sedan, with 6,777 sales in Q2, the new boss when it comes to super-lux EV sedans.\\n\\nEV sales growth and filling the gaps in infrastructure to support EV mobility continue to be the industry\\u2019s leading story. Cox Automotive expects the country to welcome 1 million new EVs to its roads in 2023, which will fuel the budding used EV market further. Sparked in part by government incentives, new battery production facilities are cropping up around the country, and factories are being retooled and rethought to support EV production. This fall, the United Auto Workers are negotiating their labor contracts with many automakers, and one topic is front and center: EVs. Even vehicle transportation and logistics \\u2013 the trucking of EVs \\u2013 is being redesigned in some part, as the current crop of EVs is heavier and harder to move than their ICE brethren.\\n\\nAnd EV sales keep growing.\\n\\nIn a recent Cox Automotive survey, more than 50% of shoppers were interested in adding an EV to their stable. Being interested is easy, of course, but far fewer people actually buy. And in the same survey, 53% of consumers agreed that EVs will eventually replace traditional ICE-powered vehicles. Dealers were more cautious, with only 31% agreeing on an all-EV future. Dealers have a front-row seat to the many challenges ahead. And many dealers, recently, have been watching EV inventory building.\\n\\nIn late June 2023, the days\\u2019 supply of EVs was over 100, whereas industry-wide inventory levels were closer to 53 days. When it comes to EV sales, the market is likely heading into its Trough of Disillusionment (hat tip to the Gartner Hype Cycle), where collaboration across many parties will be necessary to push through. Building EVs is one thing, and many in the industry are proving excellent at that skill. Selling EVs is something different altogether. Yes, EV sales records will continue to be set, and EV growth will continue to outpace overall industry growth, but the days of 75% year-over-year growth are in the rearview mirror. The hard-growth days are ahead.\",\n          \"Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. grew by 11.3% year over year in the second quarter, reaching a record-high volume of 330,4631 units, according to new estimates from Kelley Blue Book. This growth was driven partly by improved availability, higher discounts and elevated levels of leasing. Total EV sales last quarter were higher than Q1 sales by 23% percent. In Q2, market leader Tesla sales volume declined by 6.3% year over year, but new products, notably from General Motors, helped lift overall volume higher. In the second quarter, Tesla\\u2019s share of EV sales fell below 50% for the first time in the U.S. to 49.7%.\\n\\nThe sales estimates from Kelley Blue Book show that electric vehicles accounted for approximately 8% of total new-vehicle sales in the second quarter, higher than the 7.1% share in the first quarter of the year and higher than the 7.2% recorded in Q2 last year.\\n\\nCox Automotive Industry Insights Director Stephanie Valdez Streaty commented: \\u201cEV sales exceeded expectations during a record-breaking quarter. Despite Tesla\\u2019s declining sales, with its EV sales share now below 50% for the first time, the overall competitive landscape for electric vehicles is intensifying. This increased competition is leading to continued price pressure, gradually boosting EV adoption. Automakers that deliver the right product at the right price and offer an excellent consumer experience will lead the way in EV adoption.\\u201d\\n\\nWhile Tesla remains the dominant player in the EV segment, new electric offerings by mainstream competitors \\u2013 and more aggressive pricing \\u2013 continue to provide shoppers with interesting alternatives. Notable new entries in Q2 include the BMW i5, Cadillac Lyriq, Honda Prologue, and Kia EV9 SUV. Higher volumes of the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning helped the Ford brand retain its No. 2 position, behind Tesla, in the EV market.  \\n\\nNew EVs from General Motors are also helping grow industry volume. In Q2, GM added more than 21,000 EVs to the market. New models include electric versions of the Chevy Blazer, Equinox and Silverado, which tallied more than 10,000 sales in Q2, although the extra volume was not enough to offset the discontinued Chevy Bolt. In Q2, Chevrolet\\u2019s EV sales were lower by 19% year over year.  Other major players who lost ground year over year in Q2 include Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Porsche, Volvo and VW.\\n\\nAdded Valdez Streaty, \\u201cWe remain bullish on electric vehicle sales in the long term. The growth will, at times, be very slow, as all-time horizons in the automobile business are vast, but the long-term trajectory suggests that higher volumes of EVs will continue over time. As EV infrastructure and technology improve, and more models are launched, many shoppers sitting on the fence will eventually choose an EV.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df2"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":582},"id":"gfwdaO-hxc8o","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732780612759,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":375,"user":{"displayName":"채형김","userId":"13447971630655102369"}},"outputId":"b9f27826-bca8-4a6a-8e84-f09eb092933d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        date                                              title  \\\n","0   20241118  On song BYD dominates record-breaking Chinese ...   \n","1   20241002  Is Europe’s EV decline impacting market foreca...   \n","2   20240919  Which EV manufacturers performed the best in 2...   \n","3   20240905              Is the global EV market slowing down?   \n","4   20240819  How have global EV forecasts reacted to strong...   \n","5   20240725  How is Europe’s EV slowdown affecting its mark...   \n","6   20240718  Europe’s medium and heavy-duty truck markets c...   \n","7   20240613          How popular are electric buses in Europe?   \n","8   20240527  Global EV growth forecast in 2024, but challen...   \n","9   20240422     Tesla dominates European EV market in February   \n","10  20240327  Growth forecast for European EV market despite...   \n","11  20240219    What was the most popular EV worldwide in 2023?   \n","12  20240122                           Global EV Sales for 2023   \n","13  20241214  The green transition of electric trucks and buses   \n","14  20231121  EVs Forecast to Account for Two Thirds of Glob...   \n","15  20230817                        Global EV Sales for 2023 H1   \n","16  20230206                           Global EV Sales for 2022   \n","\n","                                              article  \n","0   Chinese electric vehicle (EV) deliveries soare...  \n","1   With Europe’s light vehicle market slowing, ho...  \n","2   \"Which electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers sto...  \n","3   New electric vehicle (EV) sales across the wor...  \n","4   Global electric vehicle (EV) sales are experie...  \n","5   Europe’s electric vehicle (EV) market has slow...  \n","6   The electrification of Europe’s medium and hea...  \n","7   Europe’s electric-bus market ended 2023 on a h...  \n","8   Despite current market conditions leading to a...  \n","9   Electric vehicle (EV) registrations in Europe ...  \n","10  Even with incentive changes, Europe’s new elec...  \n","11  The global electric vehicle (EV) market broke ...  \n","12  Global EV sales continued as expected by us at...  \n","13  As electric vehicles (EVs) begin to make serio...  \n","14  We forecast that global EV sales, comprising b...  \n","15  Global EV sales continue strong.

Jos\\u00e9 Pontes, data director at EV Volumes, looks into the figures with Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry.\\n\\nRegistrations of EVs, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) set a new record in China in September. More than 1.1 million units were delivered in the month, a 51% increase year on year. This is even more spectacular when considering the overall market improvement in the month was just 5%.\\n\\nGrowth came from both powertrain types. BEVs were up 29% in September, to around 644,000 units, while PHEVs jumped 97% to around 479,000 units. This was the fourth month in a row that PHEVs broke their volume record.\\n\\nSeptember\\u2019s strong results saw EVs take a 53% share of the overall Chinese new-car market. BEVs alone accounted for 31% of all deliveries. In terms of EV share, BEVs held 57% of registrations in the month, while PHEVs had 32%. The remaining 11%  share was captured by extended-range models (EREVs).\\n\\nIn the first nine months of 2024, around 7.3 million EVs have been delivered to customers, a significant rise over the 5.4 million units that were registered in the same period during 2023.\\n\\nLooking at the market share between January and September, EVs held 47%, with 27% of this belonging to BEVs. Compared with 12 months prior, the 2023 plug-in share was 37%, with BEVs making up 25% overall. This means that while BEVs have only improved market share by two percentage points (pp), PHEVs are growing faster. The technology\\u2019s share increased by around 8pp year on year.\\n\\nWith this growth, the year should end with EVs holding around 50% of the market. This means the push for full electrification by around 2030 is still heading in the right direction.\",\n          \"With Europe\\u2019s light vehicle market slowing, how have electric vehicle (EV) forecasts been affected? Neil King, head of forecasting at EV Volumes, presents the latest outlook with Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry.\\n\\nEurope\\u2019s light-vehicle market, made up of passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (LCVs), has experienced a rollercoaster ride this year. Major markets across the continent enjoyed relatively consistent growth following the end of the supply-chain crisis in August 2022.\\n\\nHowever, this year has seen instability, with strong overall increases offset by large declines. With high interest rates and the cost-of-living crisis, the automotive market is in a state of flux.\\n\\nEV Volumes has reduced its forecast for Europe\\u2019s light-vehicle market in 2024. It now expects growth of 2.4% across the continent by the end of the year, down from the 2.6% forecast in June 2024.\\n\\nAt almost 15.1 million units, this falls far short of the 18 million light vehicles registered in Europe in 2019. Moreover, EV Volumes does not see the European market returning to this level during the current forecast horizon, up to 2035.\",\n          \"Europe\\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) market has slowed in the first half of 2024. But how will it affect the market this year and beyond? Neil King, head of forecasting at EV Volumes, presents the latest forecast with Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry.\\n\\nEurope\\u2019s new light-vehicle market, made up of passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (LCVs) is undergoing a difficult year in 2024, following its bounce back from various challenges last year.\\n\\nThe passenger-car market has seen slow growth, with declines in March and May, while the LCV market is currently performing well, but offers smaller volumes into the new light-vehicle sector.\\n\\nThe latest figures are compared to a period, however, where volumes increased rapidly, following the impact of a supply-chain crisis in 2021 and 2022. This was exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, and the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nYet, the market this year is more subdued, due to high interest rates and the continuing cost-of-living crisis.\\n\\nWith this in mind, EV Volumes has revised its forecasts from March 2024. The European new light-vehicle market is now expected to grow by 2.6% this year, a lower figure than the 3.1% improvement forecast earlier this year.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":38}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ev_market = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)\n","ev_market = ev_market.sort_values(by=['date']).reset_index(drop=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"6i3CG5FIxdhc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ev_market"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":802},"id":"nhwDaGtcyebp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732780981151,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":348,"user":{"displayName":"채형김","userId":"13447971630655102369"}},"outputId":"5133e134-018e-4d38-bb05-449386e03364"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        date                                              title  \\\n","0   20230206                           Global EV Sales for 2022   \n","1   20230412  Another Record Broken: Q1 Electric Vehicle Sal...   \n","2   20230612  Electric Vehicle Sales in Q2 Strike Another Re...   \n","3   20230817                        Global EV Sales for 2023 H1   \n","4   20231012  Another Quarter, Another Record: EV Sales in t...   \n","5   20231121  EVs Forecast to Account for Two Thirds of Glob...   \n","6   20240109  A Record 1.2 Million EVs Were Sold in the U.S....   \n","7   20240122                           Global EV Sales for 2023   \n","8   20240219    What was the most popular EV worldwide in 2023?   \n","9   20240327  Growth forecast for European EV market despite...   \n","10  20240411  EV Sales Growth Slows; Market Leader Tesla Stalls   \n","11  20240422     Tesla dominates European EV market in February   \n","12  20240527  Global EV growth forecast in 2024, but challen...   \n","13  20240611  Despite Tesla Slide, EV Sales in Q2 Mark New R...   \n","14  20240613          How popular are electric buses in Europe?   \n","15  20240718  Europe’s medium and heavy-duty truck markets c...   \n","16  20240725  How is Europe’s EV slowdown affecting its mark...   \n","17  20240819  How have global EV forecasts reacted to strong...   \n","18  20240905              Is the global EV market slowing down?   \n","19  20240919  Which EV manufacturers performed the best in 2...   \n","20  20241002  Is Europe’s EV decline impacting market foreca...   \n","21  20241011  Electric Vehicle Sales Mark Another Record in ...   \n","22  20241118  On song BYD dominates record-breaking Chinese ...   \n","23  20241214  The green transition of electric trucks and buses   \n","\n","                                              article  \n","0   Global EV sales continued strong.

Leading this charge was the Tesla Model Y. Jos\\u00e9 Pontes, data director at EV-volumes.com, unpacks the year and its most popular performers.\\n\\nNew EVs, consisting of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), saw global registrations jump 35% year on year in 2023. This allowed the electric market to end above the 13 million mark for the first time.\\n\\nPlug-in models made up a record 22% of the entire new-car market in December, with BEVs accounting for 15% alone. This pushed 2023\\u2019s total EV share to 16%, a small rise from 14% in 2022. BEVs made up 11% of registrations worldwide last year, up from 10% in the previous year. It is worth considering that the overall global new-car market experienced double-digit growth in 2023.\\n\\nPHEVs (up 47%) saw registrations grow more quickly across 2023 than BEVs (up 30%). This meant the hybrid powertrain increased its share of the EV market, reaching 31%, up from 28% in 2022. The PHEV share has been fluctuating between 26% and 31% since 2018, supporting the notion that the technology could remain relevant for a while.\",\n          \"Europe\\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) market has slowed in the first half of 2024. But how will it affect the market this year and beyond? Neil King, head of forecasting at EV Volumes, presents the latest forecast with Autovista24 special content editor Phil Curry.\\n\\nEurope\\u2019s new light-vehicle market, made up of passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles (LCVs) is undergoing a difficult year in 2024, following its bounce back from various challenges last year.\\n\\nThe passenger-car market has seen slow growth, with declines in March and May, while the LCV market is currently performing well, but offers smaller volumes into the new light-vehicle sector.\\n\\nThe latest figures are compared to a period, however, where volumes increased rapidly, following the impact of a supply-chain crisis in 2021 and 2022. This was exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, and the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nYet, the market this year is more subdued, due to high interest rates and the continuing cost-of-living crisis.\\n\\nWith this in mind, EV Volumes has revised its forecasts from March 2024. The European new light-vehicle market is now expected to grow by 2.6% this year, a lower figure than the 3.1% improvement forecast earlier this year.\",\n          \"Global EV sales continued strong. A total of 10,5 million new BEVs and PHEVs were delivered during 2022, an increase of +55 % compared to 2021. The regional growth pattern is shifting, though. Following 2 years of steep sales increases in Europe, EVs gained only +15 % over 2021 there. Weak overall vehicle markets and persistent component shortages have taken their toll, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. EV sales in USA and Canada increased by 48 % year-on-year, despite a weak overall light vehicle market which plunged by 8 % during 2022 y/y. The 2nd half of 2022 saw a cautious recovery of auto markets as numbers compared to the low results of 2021 H1. Global light vehicle sales for 2022, 81 million units, were still -0,5 % lower than in 2021 and -15 % below pre-2020 levels.\\n\\nChina NEV sales defied all headwinds the country faced otherwise (real estate crisis, Covid outbreaks and lock-downs) and increased by another +82 % year-on-year. BYD more than tripled sales to 1,85 million units, making it the #1 in the global sales ranking, if their 944 500 PHEV sales are included. Counting BEVs only, Tesla still leads by a wide margin with 1,31 million units delivered in 2022.\\n\\nPHEVs stood for 27 % of global Plug-in sales in 2022 compared to 29 % in 2021. While their sales volumes still increased, their share in the PEV mix is in decline, facing headwinds from incentive cuts and improving BEV offers. Sales growth is increasingly depending on the degree of electrification. While BEVs grew by +59 % and PHEVs by +46 %, non-chargeable Full Hybrids grew by +15 % and Mild Hybrids by +1 % y-o-y. Global sales of vehicles which can be charged from the grid (10,5 m) were higher than for non-chargeable vehicles (8,4 m) for the first time in 2022. ICE-only vehicle sales declined by -7 %; their share in global light vehicle sales is 76,8 %, compared to 82,2 % in 2021. FCEV remain irrelevant for the electrification of light vehicles; their deliveries stagnated at 15 400 units in 2022, which is 0,02 % of the global, annual light vehicle volume.\\n\\nRapid EV adoption in weak auto markets has boosted EV shares further. BEVs (9,5 %) and PHEVs (3,5 %) stood for 13 % of global light vehicle sales in 2022, compared to 8,3 % in 2021. Norway had the highest market share of EVs in H1 (BEV 71 % + PHEV 8 %), China had 27 %, Europe 20,8 % and USA 7,2 %. The fastest growing markets were Indonesia (from 1k to 10k), India with +223 % to 50k, nearly all BEVs, New Zealand +151 % to 23k for 20 % market share. EV supply and adoption is now spreading rapidly into the global south. November and December of 2022 saw demand distortions by coming reductions of EV grants in Europe and China and the IRA in the US for 2023. Demand for EVs and ICEs alike were pulled into 2022 or pushed into 2023. We expect irregular EV sales and shares in several countries for Q1 of 2023. For the full year of 2023, we expect sales of 14,3 million EVs, a growth of 36 % over 2022, with BEVs reaching 8 million units and PHEVs 2,6 million units. By the end of 2023 we expect nearly 40 million EVs in operation, counting light vehicles, 73 % are BEVs and 27 % PHEVs.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":45}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ev_market.to_csv(\"/content/gdrive/MyDrive/통계분석실습/기말프로젝트/data/ev_market.csv\", index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"PvZxljXtyffW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

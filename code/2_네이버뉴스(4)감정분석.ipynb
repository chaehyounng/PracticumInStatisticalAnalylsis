Year-to-date EV sales through September reached just over 873,000, putting the market firmly on track to surpass 1 million for the first time ever. The milestone will likely be achieved in November.\\n\\nTotal EV sales in Q3, according to an estimate from Kelley Blue Book, hit 313,086, a 49.8% increase from the same period one year ago and an increase from the 298,039 sold in Q2. Most automakers posted sizeable gains over 2022, with Volvo, Nissan, Mercedes and Hyundai delivering increases above 200%, thanks mostly to new products entering the market. In Q3, 14 new EV models that did not exist one year ago were in the mix, including Chevrolet Blazer and Silverado EVs. (The new Chevy EVs had very low sales \\u2013 just an initial few to mark a Q3 launch). The EV market is transforming, to be sure.\\n\\nElectric vehicle sales accounted for 7.9% of total industry sales in Q3, a record and up from 6.1% a year ago and 7.2% in Q2. As Cox Automotive has been reporting, higher inventory levels, more product availability, and downward pricing pressure have helped spur continued linear growth of EV sales in the U.S. market. EV sales have now increased for 13 straight quarters.\\n\\nEV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped, as Tesla\\u2019s Q3 sales grew by 19.5% year over year, surpassing the industry\\u2019s overall growth rate of 16.3%. However, Tesla\\u2019s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1. The long-promised Cybertruck may reverse the downward trend, although competition from Ford, Rivian and Chevrolet will likely impact Tesla\\u2019s electric pickup volume potential.   \\n\\nThe German luxury makes \\u2013 Audi, BMW, and Mercedes \\u2013 continue to rapidly increase sales of EV models. In Q3, BMW and Mercedes EV sales more than triple year-ago levels, while Audi posted an EV sales gain of 94%.\\n\\nAmong automakers selling internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV products, Audi, BMW and Volvo had the richest mix of EVs in Q3. BMW had the highest proportion, with over 15% of its sales being EVs, followed by Audi and Volvo, with over 12% of their sales being EVs, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. Mercedes, Porsche and VW all had an EV mix in excess of 10% last quarter.\\n\\nQ3 EV SHARE OF TOTAL BRAND SALES\\n\\nIn 2020, just three years back, EV sales in the U.S. passed 250,000 for the first time. This year, the market will jump past 1 million. In Q3, Tesla remains the undisputed leader in EV sales, with Ford a distant #2 on the list, selling just over 20,000 EVs.\\n\\nMost analysts expect a flood of new EVs in the coming three years, with the number of available EV products likely to double by 2027. With this changing landscape, EV sales volume growth in the U.S. is expected to continue. Of late, product availability has grown exponentially, while consumer acceptance has grown in a more linear fashion. Those trends will likely continue, making for some very interesting market dynamics in the years ahead. Change is never easy.\",\n          \"Car manufacturers have been a bit overly optimistic about the pace of EV adoption. This has led to a sliding scale of sales expectations so that automakers can be more flexible in adjusting rollout strategies to meet consumer demand more accurately. Volkswagen is taking full advantage of its flexible strategy and is now reportedly changing the planned model order to better fit the changing EV market.\\n\\nWelcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things EV and automotive tech. Today, we're chatting about VW's pushback of its flagship \\\"Project Trinity\\\" EV, Tesla's conflicting use of government subsidies, and battery fires in South Korea. Let's jump in.\\n\\n30%: VW's Flagship \\\"Trinity\\\" EV May Be Delayed In Favor Of Electric Golf\\n\\nVolkswagen has decided to once again delay its flagship \\\"Project Trinity\\\" EV. According to recent reports from German news outlet Handelsblatt, the automaker's decision comes as part of a priority reshuffling that could favor the early launch of a battery-electric Golf instead.\\n\\nReports indicate that the automaker has chosen to abandon its original timeline of 2026 so it can better recoup its investments into current-generation underpinnings. VW is now reportedly earmarking the release of the BEV sedan for 2032.\\n\\nAutomotive News explains the reasoning behind the significant delay:\\n\\nThe delay is part of a reallocation of product launch investments by VW Group CEO Oliver Blume. It would allow the group's existing EV platforms\\u2014MEB used by VW's ID cars and PPE used for the Porsche electric Macan and Audi Q6 E-tron\\u2014to be used for longer so that their investment costs can be better amortized. The MEB platform is due to be upgraded to MEB+ in 2026 and the PPE platform will get a software upgrade within the next 36 months with help from VW Group's new partner Rivian, Handelsblatt said. The postponement is also a reaction of the slowdown of the EV market and Blume's cost-cutting drive, sources told the paper.\\n\\nThe new product rollout will now reportedly prioritize a fully-electric Golf (codenamed \\\"ID Golf\\\") as the first vehicle to launch on the new SSP underpinnings in 2026, followed by a fully-electric Audi A4 in 2028. The report also claims that Volkswagen's ID.4 successor would be pushed back from 2028 until 2030 and a BEV crossover delayed from 2029 to 2031.\\n\\nOriginally announced in early 2021 under VW's former dieselgate-era CEO Herbert Diess, Project Trinity is set to be Volkswagen's flagship successor to the ID family of vehicles. Not only was Trinity planned to be the first car to ride on VW's Scalable Systems Platform (SSP)\\u2014the upcoming modular platform that is said to offer faster charging and up to 1,700 horsepower\\u2014but it is also poised to debut some Level 4 self-driving features.\\n\\nCurrent VW CEO Oliver Blume has already delayed the EV once before in 2022. The first delay pushed it back from 2026 to 2030 over software concerns\\u2014a concern that is hopefully now moot with VW's new $5 billion Rivian partnership. The delay also solidifies the automaker's previous plans to extend its MEB platform until 2030.\\n\\n60%: Charge, Baby, Charge: Tesla's Insatiable Appetite For Subsidies And Government Support\\n\\n\\\"Take away the subsidies,\\\" wrote Tesla CEO Elon Musk on his social media platform, X, just last month. \\\"It will only help Tesla.\\\"\\n\\nMusk was, of course, referring to the $7,500 EV tax credit which has helped to fuel the success of Tesla over the years, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future as long as the automaker continues to build vehicles compliant with the program's requirements.\\n\\nBut Despite Musk's sentiment towards tax credits and government subsidies, Tesla has continued to show that its opinion vastly differs from that of its CEOs. And as noted in a recent report from Reuters, Tesla has established a clear pattern of lobbying in favor for regulation that directly opposes its CEO's public cry for less government-provided support.\\n\\nFrom Reuters:\\n\\nIn February, for instance, Tesla in a filing with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, urged the Biden administration to allow California to pursue stricter vehicle emissions rules than the rest of the country\\u2014an idea Trump opposes. Months earlier, in a previous filing with the agency, Tesla lobbied the government for regulations that would ban the production of most new gasoline cars by 2035\\u2014the so-called \\\"EV mandate\\\" that Trump and others on the American right have criticized. The disparity is hardly the first time that the billionaire entrepreneur\\u2014himself increasingly dismissive of subsidies\\u2014has sent mixed signals on business and politics.\\n\\nTesla has a history of gobbling up whatever taxpayer-sponsored subsidies that benefits it. As Reuters outlined above, Tesla's biggest sale as of late has been the sale of regulatory credits, which alone bolstered its bottom line by $890 million in the second quarter of 2024.\\n\\nTesla has also changed the way it does business in order to take advantage of government-sponsored funding. In Canada, for example, the automaker launched a compliance-spec Model 3 with just 94 miles of range, which, yes, people bought. And in France, Tesla offers the Model Y in a two-seater configuration in order to qualify for a tax break for business-to-business customers.\\n\\nReuters outlines other examples of Tesla's use\\u2014and push for\\u2014government support and subsidies through its previous actions:\\n\\n[T]he public record clearly shows that Tesla, since its founding over two decades ago, has benefitted from government assistance, largely because of its role in moving the U.S. toward cleaner cars. Tesla's first major manufacturing facility, in Fremont, California, was developed with the help of a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, repaid three years later. More recently, Tesla has reaped almost $9 billion since 2018 by selling what are known as \\\"regulatory credits, opens new tab,\\\" securities filings show. The credits, awarded in the U.S. by the federal and state governments to manufacturers who surpass increasingly strict emissions rules, can be sold to other carmakers who are unable to comply. \\\"There was no Tesla without California's regulatory bodies,\\\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a 2022 conference, citing the importance of the state's credits to the carmaker's finances. A Reuters review of Congressional lobbying records\\u2014and Tesla's public comments to federal and state regulators\\u2014shows that the company has continued working to shape public policy in favor of such benefits. Earlier this year, in a February filing with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Tesla said that sustained government support, by accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels, would \\\"mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and protect the country's public health and welfare.\\\"\\n\\nIt's unclear if Musk's words are a strong marketing tactic to pursue more conservative buyers, or if the CEO's opinions vastly differs from the company's actions. In a recent interview with former president Donald Trump, Musk said that the world shouldn't \\\"vilify the oil and gas industry\\\" because the climate risk \\\"is not as high\\\" or immediate as some experts stress. Previously, Musk publicly supported carbon taxes in order to combat both pollution and offset subsidies which help make petroleum-based fuels less expensive.\\n\\nIn Tesla's defense, if the government is offering a discount or advantage for consumers to buy your product, it seems to be in the best fiduciary interest of the company to take advantage of it. However, on the other hand, its CEO calling to end those very programs because they are unnecessary to the organization's success feels like an unwise chess move.\\n\\n90%: BMW, Mercedes Battery Makers Revealed After South Korea Urges Transparency Following Fires\\n\\nThe government of South Korea is urging automakers for more transparency\\u2014specifically, voluntary disclosure of the manufacturers of batteries used in their vehicles.\\n\\nOfficials are responding to \\\"EV phobia\\\" after lithium fires in battery-electric cars have sparked public concern across the country in recent weeks. In particular, Korean citizens are on edge after a Mercedes-Benz EQE burst into flames earlier this month and damaged 140 vehicles in an underground parking garage during the eight-hour blaze.\\n\\nFollowing the fire, automakers have begun to publicly disclose the batteries used in their EVs\\u2014at least in the Korean market. Bloomberg called the disclosure \\\"a rare move,\\\" noting that car makers typically keep this information confidential but appear to be willing to publish it as a means of transparency given current events.\\n\\nMercedes revealed cells supplied LG Energy Solution (LGES), CATL, SK, and Farasis Energy. BMW revealed that its cars use cells supplied by Samsung SDI and CATL. Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis use cells provided by LGES, SK, and CATL.\\n\\nAccording to reports from local media, the EQE that caught fire in early August was using batteries from China's Farasis Energy, though there is no current correlation noted between a battery cell manufacturer and the risk of fire. Mercedes is currently offering free inspections of all of its EVs in Korea and has drawn up a fund of $3.3 million to help individuals affected by the fire. An investigation into the blaze is still ongoing.\\n\\n\\\"It\\u2019s difficult to tell at this point whether Farasis batteries are the problem, but there\\u2019s a general sentiment that the risk is higher with smaller battery makers than major producers like CATL or Korean makers,\\\" said Korean-based DS Asset Management Co. fund manager, Yoon Joonwon, in a statement to Bloomberg. \\\"Until the issue is resolved, consumer sentiment toward EVs is expected to remain deteriorated for some time.\\\"\\n\\nSouth Korea's Office for Government Policy Coordination says that it has discussed EV safety concerns with industry experts and related government departments. Officials will develop comprehensive safety measures in the coming months to address its concerns.\\n\\n100%: Has The EV Tax Credit Helped You Decide On A Battery-Electric Car?\\n\\nThe EV tax credit is one of the most powerful tools that any car buyer considering an EV can leverage right now. It's far from being free money, but for many, it sure feels that way when they can simply eliminate $7,500 off the bottom line with the stroke of a pen.\\n\\nWhen I was shopping around for an EV last year, it was one of my main concerns. In fact, I passed up on some of my more preferential EVs (like the Kia EV6 GT) because the cars didn't qualify for the EV tax credit. And I expect to set that same expectation for whatever EV I purchase next as well\\u2014assuming the credit is still around after November, that is.\\n\\nThose of you who have purchased an EV (or are looking to purchase an EV): has the tax credit influenced your decisions? Let me know in the comments.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"Electric vehicle (EV) sales growth in the U.S. continues to slow, according to sales data analyzed by Kelley Blue Book. In the first quarter of 2024, Americans bought 268,909 new electric vehicles, according to Kelley Blue Book counts. EV share of total new-vehicle sales in Q1 was 7.3%, a decrease from Q4 2023.\\n\\nWhile annual EV sales continue to grow in the U.S. market, the growth rate has slowed notably. Sales in Q1 rose 2.6% year over year, but fell 15.2% compared to Q4 2023. The increase last quarter was well below the previous two years.\\n\\nIn Q1 2023, EV sales volumes were up 46.4% year over year and 15.5% quarter over quarter. In Q1 2022, EV sales were higher by 81.2% year over year and 20.4% higher than the previous quarter.\\n\\n\\u201cElectric vehicle sales in the U.S. declined during Q1 2024 \\u2013 the first quarter-over-quarter downturn since Q2 2020,\\u201d said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive.\\n\\n\\u201cAs anticipated, Tesla\\u2019s sales took a hit, influencing the overall market dynamics. However, a few brands saw significant EV sales increases, achieving over 50% year-over-year growth. As noted in January, we are calling 2024, \\u2018the Year of More\\u2019. More new products, more incentives, more inventory, more leasing and more infrastructure will drive EV sales higher this year. Even so, we\\u2019ll continue to see ups and downs as the industry moves towards electrification.\\u201d\\n\\nAnalysts at Cox Automotive had expected a slowdown in EV sales growth. Segment growth typically slows as volume increases. This is certainly true with the market leader Tesla, which reported notably lower global deliveries in Q1 2024.\\n\\nAccording to Kelley Blue Book estimates, Tesla sales in the U.S. were down 13.3% year over year \\u2013 well below the typical double-digit growth that had become routine with the Tesla brand. Tesla\\u2019s share of the electric vehicle market in Q1 2024 was 51.3%, down from 61.7% one year earlier.\\n\\nThough the overall year-over-year growth was minimal in Q1, nine manufacturers recorded more than 50% year-over-year growth in EV sales \\u2013 BMW, Cadillac, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Lexus, Mercedes, Rivian and Vinfast.\\n\\nNotably, lower prices have supported EV sales volume in the U.S., particularly for key Tesla models. The average transaction price for a new EV in Q1 was $55,167, a 9.0% decrease compared to Q1 2023 and down 3.8% quarter over quarter. Tesla\\u2019s average transaction price was $52,315 in Q1, down roughly 13.5% year over year. However, lower prices did not generate higher volume.\\n\\nMany automakers have followed Tesla\\u2019s lead and slashed prices. Incentive spending on EVs has increased notably in the past year, another sign of slowing demand. Leasing, too, has increased. In Q1, roughly 27% of all EVs were leased, more than double from the year before. With leasing, many buyers can qualify for the full $7,500 incentive the Inflation Reduction Act offers.\\n\\nOne bright spot in Q1: Strong EV sales from luxury makers, suggesting the EV market continues to be luxury-driven. Cadillac achieved a 499.2% year-over-year increase in electric vehicle sales due to robust sales of its Lyriq model. At Mercedes, EV sales were up 66.9%. BMW posted a 62.6% increase in EV sales compared to Q1 2023. At Audi, Q1 EV sales grew 28.8% year over year.\\n\\nMeanwhile, sales of the most affordable EV in the U.S. \\u2013 the Chevy Bolt \\u2013 have been temporarily halted. Bolt sales fell 64.3% year over year in Q1, hitting just 7,040, as production stopped. A new version of the Bolt is expected to launch in 2025. On the non-luxury side, Ford achieved an 86.1% year-over-year increase in Q1 EV sales with the second-highest EV sales volume behind Tesla.\\n\\nCox Automotive forecasts EV sales in the U.S. to increase year over year in 2024, making this year the best year ever for EV sales. Analysts expect EV sales to reach roughly 10% of the market by the end of the year, up from 7.3% in the first quarter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":54}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.dtypes"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"id":"Cw0Njgke6qCM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733154938007,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"채형김","userId":"13447971630655102369"}},"outputId":"511d50c6-65c3-4bc6-d824-e1af4882230c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["date        int64\n","title      object\n","article    object\n","dtype: object"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <td>int64</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <td>object</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>article</th>\n","      <td>object</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> object</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":55}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = df.sort_values(by=['date']).reset_index(drop=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"kylpmR8V5_HH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], format=\"%Y%m%d\")\n","df['date'] = df['date'].dt.strftime(\"%Y-%m\")"],"metadata":{"id":"hwHuID6064Kc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"QZWJ5cJUFV3h","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733154949355,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":282,"user":{"displayName":"채형김","userId":"13447971630655102369"}},"outputId":"8615faf1-bd12-4934-8ebc-5990e11bc10f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       date                                              title  \\\n","0   2023-02                           Global EV Sales for 2022   \n","1   2023-02  Hyundai USA Launches Evolve+ EV Subscription P...   \n","2   2023-03          Hyundai Kona N Electric May Be On The Way   \n","3   2023-03  Hyundai Surprised At The Success Of The Ioniq ...   \n","4   2023-03  Hyundai Finds Causes For Ioniq 5's 12V Battery...   \n","..      ...                                                ...   \n","78  2024-11  Hyundai Ioniq 9: A Three-Row EV With 335 Miles...   \n","79  2024-11  'It Would Just Be Dumb': Kia Exec On Plan To K...   \n","80  2024-11   GM And Hyundai EV Pickup Could Be In Development   \n","81  2024-11  Kia Eyes PHEVs With 60 Miles Of Electric Range...   \n","82  2024-12  The green transition of electric trucks and buses   \n","\n","                                              article  \n","0   Global EV sales continued strong.

The news was broken by one Ioniq 5 owner on his YouTube channel, The Ioniq Guy, who said in a recent video (embedded above) he was contacted by a Hyundai PR representative with an update from the engineering department.\\n\\nWe were able to verify the PR statement from his video with Hyundai for accuracy and learn some more, so here are the main takeaways. The automaker says the 12-volt battery drain has been caused by two different unrelated issues.\\n\\nHyundai Ioniq frunk plastic lid and 12-volt battery\\n\\nThe main one is \\\"overactive unauthorized Bluelink use by 3rd party apps that is waking up the car too often.\\\" Basically, unauthorized third-party Bluelink apps are requesting information too frequently from the Ioniq 5. Each time that happens it wakes up the vehicle, causing significant draw until it goes to sleep.\\n\\nWhile the drive battery has enough energy to recharge the 12-volt battery multiple times, the battery saving mode cannot keep up with hundreds of even thousands requests per day \\u2013 The Ioniq Guy says the PR rep told him some of the vehicles were seeing as many as 5,000 Bluelink requests per day.\\n\\nAccording to Hyundai, the 12-volt battery drain issue has been resolved since January 31 by limiting Bluelink server traffic to 20 transactions per day. In addition, certain problematic unauthorized apps were blocked by the server, although their name was not disclosed. Customers were also informed to change their Bluelink password.\\n\\nNow, while most vehicles are solved since January 31, Hyundai says some came back and required 12V battery replacement for failing to take charge after the battery was dead too many times or for too long before January 31.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe second cause that's not covered in the video but was communicated to InsideEVs is something Hyundai calls \\\"EV Light On with DTC P1A9096 ICCU related.\\\" To solve this issue, the Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU) and ICCU fuse have to be replaced.\\n\\nNow, some vehicles that only had the ICCU fuse replaced also incurred Diagnostic Trouble Code P1B77 (high voltage error in the battery pack) as a result of ICCU failure. DTC P1B77 cases required the Power Relay Assembly (PRA) in the EV battery to be replaced as well.\\n\\nHyundai also told InsideEVs that a rumor going around on forums lately about the ICCU campaign in Korea for coolant leak being possibly related and causing the above issue is false.\\n\\n\\\"Fact: Not related. The Korea issue pertained to an Inverter Coolant Low Warning light on, not an EV Light On issue. It only applied to vehicles before 4/23/21 Production. Above issues have not been specific to such mfg period.\\\"\\n\\nIf you own a Hyundai Ioniq 5 \\u2013 or a Kia EV6 or Genesis GV60 which are based on the same E-GMP architecture \\u2013 and encountered 12V battery drain issues please share your experience in the comments section.\\n\\nSource: Hyundai via The Ioniq Guy (YouTube)\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"All of the Hyundai Motor Group electric vehicles based on the E-GMP platform so far have been rear-wheel-drive vehicles with optional dual-motor all-wheel-drive. Now Kia is going front-wheel drive with its smaller EVs, like the EV3 and EV5, but in an age of modular skateboard EV platforms, it may not be obvious why.\\n\\nBefore we had EVs built on dedicated platforms, the rule was that cheap combustion cars were front-wheel drive, and power went to the back wheels only in more expensive models. Front-wheel-drive evolved as the industry standard in the 1970s and 1980s as cars got smaller and the layout provided lots of cost-savings and packaging benefits too; one bonus was that they tended to perform better in snow than RWD cars too.\\n\\nBut then smaller, more affordable EVs like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 brought RWD to a lower price point and made it available to many more people.\\n\\nGet Fully Charged All sub-EV6 models from Kia will be front-wheel-drive All the Hyundai-Kia group vehicles built on E-GMP so far have been rear-wheel-drive, but now Kia is going front-wheel drive with its smaller electric offerings starting with the EV5 and all models below it in the range.\\n\\nWhere you put the motor in an EV has a lot less impact on the packaging of the vehicle than it does in a combustion car. You don\\u2019t need a prop shaft to send power to the other side of the vehicle, and electric motors are considerably more compact than combustion engines. So even if you put the motor in the back, you will still have enough space for a decent-sized trunk.\\n\\nDuring a media briefing event about the EV3, Kia's Head of Global Business Planning, Spencer Cho, explained that in this compact crossover class it's about giving the customer what they're most used to.\\n\\n\\\"This will be the front-wheel-drive models, which are targeted for... the affordable EVs the customers are looking for,\\\" Cho said. He said the EV3 is initially meant as less of a \\\"performance\\\" vehicle than the EV6 or even EV9. \\\"EV3 is targeting the mainstream EV buyers, so that's why we have chosen E-GMP with front-wheel-drive, which is much lighter.\\\"\\n\\nCho didn\\u2019t go into detail about how the weight savings were achieved, but he gave this as the only reason for the decision.\\n\\n\\\"The packaging is much lighter,\\\" he said. \\\"Also, the performance standpoint is right for the customers in the compact SUV category.\\\"\\n\\nGallery: Kia EV3 2024\\n\\n40\\n\\nCost is surely another reason, and Kia could probably save on wiring and having to run less of it to the rear of the car, as well as simplifying some of the components. Another big cost-driven change brought to smaller E-GMP-based vehicles like the EV3 is the downgrade from 800 to 400 volts, which will allow Kia to use cheaper parts than what is required for the higher-voltage application.\\n\\nSwitching from front- to rear-wheel drive is much easier in an EV, and FWD still has its advantages. For instance, by not having a motor under the trunk floor, the cargo compartment can be deeper, allowing you to carry taller items and increasing the overall maximum possible load volume. Small crossover buyers are all about practicality and usability, and having a bigger trunk in the back is more important than having a smaller trunk and a bit of extra storage in the frunk.\\n\\nThe Kia EV3 offers the best of both worlds: a roomy 460-liter (16.2 cubic-feet) trunk with a false floor that reveals additional storage space and a small 25-liter (0.8 cu-ft) frunk that looks like it might even be a bit deeper than on other E-GMP cars. Kia puts a frunk in most of its electric vehicles, even the Niro EV, which is built on a combustion car platform, so the fact that the EV3 has one isn\\u2019t surprising.\\n\\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox.

The EV3 will have more understeer built into its suspension setup, and it probably won\\u2019t be quite as fun to drive, although the driving experience difference between front- and rear-wheel-drive EVs is not as obvious as in combustion vehicles.\\n\\nKia will offer dual-motor all-wheel, even a spicy EV3 GT, which will feel better to drive and provide a lot more performance. Having the second motor in the rear will limit the underfloor space in the trunk, but having more than double the power of the base model will more than make up for it.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"UPDATE: A Kia America spokesperson told InsideEVs that \\\"the bonus is only $7,500,\\\" which suggests customers cannot combine it with the $7,500 tax credit. We followed up asking if Kia Finance America is getting the $7,500 tax credit and passing it over to customers in the form of the EV lease bonus. \\\"Unfortunately, I cannot comment on behalf of Kia Finance,\\\" the spokesperson replied. Original story follows below.\\n\\nThe Kia EV6 is one of the most attractive models in its segment, but the fact it no longer qualifies for federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a turn off for many US buyers.\\n\\nKia America has decided to change that and offer a $7,500 EV lease bonus \\u2013 matching the maximum federal tax credit \\u2013 for the electric crossover on a lease of a new 2023 EV6.\\n\\nThe offer is valid from May 15 to July 5, with the $7,500 EV lease bonus applied as a capitalized cost reduction. For example, well-qualified lessees approved by Kia Finance can lease a 2023 Kia EV6 Wind RWD for $499 a month for 36 months with $4,999 due at lease inception.\\n\\nIn addition to the lease promotion, Kia Finance America is offering well-qualified buyers up to $3,750 in standard-rate finance bonus cash towards the purchase of a new 2023 Kia EV6.\\n\\n\\\"The Kia EV6 has been a home run, and this is an opportunity we think will appeal to many customers anxious to experience the EV lifestyle. With multiple available motor and drivetrain layouts and an EPA-estimated all-electric range of more than 300 miles in some variants, the EV6 offers something for everyone, and these special offers make it easier for customers to get behind the wheel of this exciting vehicle.\\\" Steven Center, COO & EVP, Kia America\\n\\n28\\n\\nInterestingly, Kia's press release does not include anything about the loophole that temporarily enables all new leased EVs to qualify for the maximum $7,500 federal tax credit. We've contacted Kia to learn if the $7,500 EV lease bonus for the EV6 is in addition to the tax credit and we'll update this story when we hear back.\\n\\nThe loophole enables leasing companies to receive tax credits for EVs even if the IRA vehicle and battery assembly requirements are not met, and the companies can choose to pass those savings onto customers.\\n\\nThe 2023 Kia EV6 is offered in three variants: Wind, GT-Line and GT. Wind and GT-Line are available in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive, while the range-topping GT only comes with all-wheel drive.\\n\\nBased on Hyundai Motor Group's E-GMP electric vehicle architecture, the EV6 is compatible with ultrafast 800V DC fast chargers, going from 10 to 80 percent state of charge in approximately 18 minutes on a 350-kW charger.\\n\\nThe electric crossover is EPA-rated at 310 miles of all-electric range (AER) on the GT-Line (RWD) and Wind (RWD) trims and offers available vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality.\\n\\nThe base Kia EV6 Wind RWD starts at $48,700, while the Wind AWD is priced from $52,600. The EV6 RWD GT-Line trim costs $52,900, while the GT-Line AWD starts at $57,600. The range-topping EV6 GT is priced from $61,600. All prices exclude a $1,325 destination fee.\\n\\nSource: Kia America\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":58}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def gpt_summarize_article(text):\n","    try:\n","        completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n","            model=\"gpt-4o\",\n","            messages=[\n","                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant specializing in summarization.\"},\n","                {\n","                    \"role\": \"user\",\n","                    \"content\": f\"Summarize this article into one sentence, focusing on what it says about the EV market sales and Hyundai-Kia EVs sales.

The news was broken by one Ioniq 5 owner on his YouTube channel, The Ioniq Guy, who said in a recent video (embedded above) he was contacted by a Hyundai PR representative with an update from the engineering department.\\n\\nWe were able to verify the PR statement from his video with Hyundai for accuracy and learn some more, so here are the main takeaways. The automaker says the 12-volt battery drain has been caused by two different unrelated issues.\\n\\nHyundai Ioniq frunk plastic lid and 12-volt battery\\n\\nThe main one is \\\"overactive unauthorized Bluelink use by 3rd party apps that is waking up the car too often.\\\" Basically, unauthorized third-party Bluelink apps are requesting information too frequently from the Ioniq 5. Each time that happens it wakes up the vehicle, causing significant draw until it goes to sleep.\\n\\nWhile the drive battery has enough energy to recharge the 12-volt battery multiple times, the battery saving mode cannot keep up with hundreds of even thousands requests per day \\u2013 The Ioniq Guy says the PR rep told him some of the vehicles were seeing as many as 5,000 Bluelink requests per day.\\n\\nAccording to Hyundai, the 12-volt battery drain issue has been resolved since January 31 by limiting Bluelink server traffic to 20 transactions per day. In addition, certain problematic unauthorized apps were blocked by the server, although their name was not disclosed. Customers were also informed to change their Bluelink password.\\n\\nNow, while most vehicles are solved since January 31, Hyundai says some came back and required 12V battery replacement for failing to take charge after the battery was dead too many times or for too long before January 31.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe second cause that's not covered in the video but was communicated to InsideEVs is something Hyundai calls \\\"EV Light On with DTC P1A9096 ICCU related.\\\" To solve this issue, the Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU) and ICCU fuse have to be replaced.\\n\\nNow, some vehicles that only had the ICCU fuse replaced also incurred Diagnostic Trouble Code P1B77 (high voltage error in the battery pack) as a result of ICCU failure. DTC P1B77 cases required the Power Relay Assembly (PRA) in the EV battery to be replaced as well.\\n\\nHyundai also told InsideEVs that a rumor going around on forums lately about the ICCU campaign in Korea for coolant leak being possibly related and causing the above issue is false.\\n\\n\\\"Fact: Not related. The Korea issue pertained to an Inverter Coolant Low Warning light on, not an EV Light On issue. It only applied to vehicles before 4/23/21 Production. Above issues have not been specific to such mfg period.\\\"\\n\\nIf you own a Hyundai Ioniq 5 \\u2013 or a Kia EV6 or Genesis GV60 which are based on the same E-GMP architecture \\u2013 and encountered 12V battery drain issues please share your experience in the comments section.\\n\\nSource: Hyundai via The Ioniq Guy (YouTube)\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"All of the Hyundai Motor Group electric vehicles based on the E-GMP platform so far have been rear-wheel-drive vehicles with optional dual-motor all-wheel-drive. Now Kia is going front-wheel drive with its smaller EVs, like the EV3 and EV5, but in an age of modular skateboard EV platforms, it may not be obvious why.\\n\\nBefore we had EVs built on dedicated platforms, the rule was that cheap combustion cars were front-wheel drive, and power went to the back wheels only in more expensive models. Front-wheel-drive evolved as the industry standard in the 1970s and 1980s as cars got smaller and the layout provided lots of cost-savings and packaging benefits too; one bonus was that they tended to perform better in snow than RWD cars too.\\n\\nBut then smaller, more affordable EVs like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 brought RWD to a lower price point and made it available to many more people.\\n\\nGet Fully Charged All sub-EV6 models from Kia will be front-wheel-drive All the Hyundai-Kia group vehicles built on E-GMP so far have been rear-wheel-drive, but now Kia is going front-wheel drive with its smaller electric offerings starting with the EV5 and all models below it in the range.\\n\\nWhere you put the motor in an EV has a lot less impact on the packaging of the vehicle than it does in a combustion car. You don\\u2019t need a prop shaft to send power to the other side of the vehicle, and electric motors are considerably more compact than combustion engines. So even if you put the motor in the back, you will still have enough space for a decent-sized trunk.\\n\\nDuring a media briefing event about the EV3, Kia's Head of Global Business Planning, Spencer Cho, explained that in this compact crossover class it's about giving the customer what they're most used to.\\n\\n\\\"This will be the front-wheel-drive models, which are targeted for... the affordable EVs the customers are looking for,\\\" Cho said. He said the EV3 is initially meant as less of a \\\"performance\\\" vehicle than the EV6 or even EV9. \\\"EV3 is targeting the mainstream EV buyers, so that's why we have chosen E-GMP with front-wheel-drive, which is much lighter.\\\"\\n\\nCho didn\\u2019t go into detail about how the weight savings were achieved, but he gave this as the only reason for the decision.\\n\\n\\\"The packaging is much lighter,\\\" he said. \\\"Also, the performance standpoint is right for the customers in the compact SUV category.\\\"\\n\\nGallery: Kia EV3 2024\\n\\n40\\n\\nCost is surely another reason, and Kia could probably save on wiring and having to run less of it to the rear of the car, as well as simplifying some of the components. Another big cost-driven change brought to smaller E-GMP-based vehicles like the EV3 is the downgrade from 800 to 400 volts, which will allow Kia to use cheaper parts than what is required for the higher-voltage application.\\n\\nSwitching from front- to rear-wheel drive is much easier in an EV, and FWD still has its advantages. For instance, by not having a motor under the trunk floor, the cargo compartment can be deeper, allowing you to carry taller items and increasing the overall maximum possible load volume. Small crossover buyers are all about practicality and usability, and having a bigger trunk in the back is more important than having a smaller trunk and a bit of extra storage in the frunk.\\n\\nThe Kia EV3 offers the best of both worlds: a roomy 460-liter (16.2 cubic-feet) trunk with a false floor that reveals additional storage space and a small 25-liter (0.8 cu-ft) frunk that looks like it might even be a bit deeper than on other E-GMP cars. Kia puts a frunk in most of its electric vehicles, even the Niro EV, which is built on a combustion car platform, so the fact that the EV3 has one isn\\u2019t surprising.\\n\\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox.

The EV3 will have more understeer built into its suspension setup, and it probably won\\u2019t be quite as fun to drive, although the driving experience difference between front- and rear-wheel-drive EVs is not as obvious as in combustion vehicles.\\n\\nKia will offer dual-motor all-wheel, even a spicy EV3 GT, which will feel better to drive and provide a lot more performance. Having the second motor in the rear will limit the underfloor space in the trunk, but having more than double the power of the base model will more than make up for it.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"UPDATE: A Kia America spokesperson told InsideEVs that \\\"the bonus is only $7,500,\\\" which suggests customers cannot combine it with the $7,500 tax credit. We followed up asking if Kia Finance America is getting the $7,500 tax credit and passing it over to customers in the form of the EV lease bonus. \\\"Unfortunately, I cannot comment on behalf of Kia Finance,\\\" the spokesperson replied. Original story follows below.\\n\\nThe Kia EV6 is one of the most attractive models in its segment, but the fact it no longer qualifies for federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a turn off for many US buyers.\\n\\nKia America has decided to change that and offer a $7,500 EV lease bonus \\u2013 matching the maximum federal tax credit \\u2013 for the electric crossover on a lease of a new 2023 EV6.\\n\\nThe offer is valid from May 15 to July 5, with the $7,500 EV lease bonus applied as a capitalized cost reduction. For example, well-qualified lessees approved by Kia Finance can lease a 2023 Kia EV6 Wind RWD for $499 a month for 36 months with $4,999 due at lease inception.\\n\\nIn addition to the lease promotion, Kia Finance America is offering well-qualified buyers up to $3,750 in standard-rate finance bonus cash towards the purchase of a new 2023 Kia EV6.\\n\\n\\\"The Kia EV6 has been a home run, and this is an opportunity we think will appeal to many customers anxious to experience the EV lifestyle. With multiple available motor and drivetrain layouts and an EPA-estimated all-electric range of more than 300 miles in some variants, the EV6 offers something for everyone, and these special offers make it easier for customers to get behind the wheel of this exciting vehicle.\\\" Steven Center, COO & EVP, Kia America\\n\\n28\\n\\nInterestingly, Kia's press release does not include anything about the loophole that temporarily enables all new leased EVs to qualify for the maximum $7,500 federal tax credit. We've contacted Kia to learn if the $7,500 EV lease bonus for the EV6 is in addition to the tax credit and we'll update this story when we hear back.\\n\\nThe loophole enables leasing companies to receive tax credits for EVs even if the IRA vehicle and battery assembly requirements are not met, and the companies can choose to pass those savings onto customers.\\n\\nThe 2023 Kia EV6 is offered in three variants: Wind, GT-Line and GT. Wind and GT-Line are available in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive, while the range-topping GT only comes with all-wheel drive.\\n\\nBased on Hyundai Motor Group's E-GMP electric vehicle architecture, the EV6 is compatible with ultrafast 800V DC fast chargers, going from 10 to 80 percent state of charge in approximately 18 minutes on a 350-kW charger.\\n\\nThe electric crossover is EPA-rated at 310 miles of all-electric range (AER) on the GT-Line (RWD) and Wind (RWD) trims and offers available vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality.\\n\\nThe base Kia EV6 Wind RWD starts at $48,700, while the Wind AWD is priced from $52,600. The EV6 RWD GT-Line trim costs $52,900, while the GT-Line AWD starts at $57,600. The range-topping EV6 GT is priced from $61,600.

The news was broken by one Ioniq 5 owner on his YouTube channel, The Ioniq Guy, who said in a recent video (embedded above) he was contacted by a Hyundai PR representative with an update from the engineering department.\\n\\nWe were able to verify the PR statement from his video with Hyundai for accuracy and learn some more, so here are the main takeaways. The automaker says the 12-volt battery drain has been caused by two different unrelated issues.\\n\\nHyundai Ioniq frunk plastic lid and 12-volt battery\\n\\nThe main one is \\\"overactive unauthorized Bluelink use by 3rd party apps that is waking up the car too often.\\\" Basically, unauthorized third-party Bluelink apps are requesting information too frequently from the Ioniq 5. Each time that happens it wakes up the vehicle, causing significant draw until it goes to sleep.\\n\\nWhile the drive battery has enough energy to recharge the 12-volt battery multiple times, the battery saving mode cannot keep up with hundreds of even thousands requests per day \\u2013 The Ioniq Guy says the PR rep told him some of the vehicles were seeing as many as 5,000 Bluelink requests per day.\\n\\nAccording to Hyundai, the 12-volt battery drain issue has been resolved since January 31 by limiting Bluelink server traffic to 20 transactions per day. In addition, certain problematic unauthorized apps were blocked by the server, although their name was not disclosed. Customers were also informed to change their Bluelink password.\\n\\nNow, while most vehicles are solved since January 31, Hyundai says some came back and required 12V battery replacement for failing to take charge after the battery was dead too many times or for too long before January 31.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe second cause that's not covered in the video but was communicated to InsideEVs is something Hyundai calls \\\"EV Light On with DTC P1A9096 ICCU related.\\\" To solve this issue, the Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU) and ICCU fuse have to be replaced.\\n\\nNow, some vehicles that only had the ICCU fuse replaced also incurred Diagnostic Trouble Code P1B77 (high voltage error in the battery pack) as a result of ICCU failure. DTC P1B77 cases required the Power Relay Assembly (PRA) in the EV battery to be replaced as well.\\n\\nHyundai also told InsideEVs that a rumor going around on forums lately about the ICCU campaign in Korea for coolant leak being possibly related and causing the above issue is false.\\n\\n\\\"Fact: Not related. The Korea issue pertained to an Inverter Coolant Low Warning light on, not an EV Light On issue. It only applied to vehicles before 4/23/21 Production. Above issues have not been specific to such mfg period.\\\"\\n\\nIf you own a Hyundai Ioniq 5 \\u2013 or a Kia EV6 or Genesis GV60 which are based on the same E-GMP architecture \\u2013 and encountered 12V battery drain issues please share your experience in the comments section.\\n\\nSource: Hyundai via The Ioniq Guy (YouTube)\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"All of the Hyundai Motor Group electric vehicles based on the E-GMP platform so far have been rear-wheel-drive vehicles with optional dual-motor all-wheel-drive. Now Kia is going front-wheel drive with its smaller EVs, like the EV3 and EV5, but in an age of modular skateboard EV platforms, it may not be obvious why.\\n\\nBefore we had EVs built on dedicated platforms, the rule was that cheap combustion cars were front-wheel drive, and power went to the back wheels only in more expensive models. Front-wheel-drive evolved as the industry standard in the 1970s and 1980s as cars got smaller and the layout provided lots of cost-savings and packaging benefits too; one bonus was that they tended to perform better in snow than RWD cars too.\\n\\nBut then smaller, more affordable EVs like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 brought RWD to a lower price point and made it available to many more people.\\n\\nGet Fully Charged All sub-EV6 models from Kia will be front-wheel-drive All the Hyundai-Kia group vehicles built on E-GMP so far have been rear-wheel-drive, but now Kia is going front-wheel drive with its smaller electric offerings starting with the EV5 and all models below it in the range.\\n\\nWhere you put the motor in an EV has a lot less impact on the packaging of the vehicle than it does in a combustion car. You don\\u2019t need a prop shaft to send power to the other side of the vehicle, and electric motors are considerably more compact than combustion engines. So even if you put the motor in the back, you will still have enough space for a decent-sized trunk.\\n\\nDuring a media briefing event about the EV3, Kia's Head of Global Business Planning, Spencer Cho, explained that in this compact crossover class it's about giving the customer what they're most used to.\\n\\n\\\"This will be the front-wheel-drive models, which are targeted for... the affordable EVs the customers are looking for,\\\" Cho said. He said the EV3 is initially meant as less of a \\\"performance\\\" vehicle than the EV6 or even EV9. \\\"EV3 is targeting the mainstream EV buyers, so that's why we have chosen E-GMP with front-wheel-drive, which is much lighter.\\\"\\n\\nCho didn\\u2019t go into detail about how the weight savings were achieved, but he gave this as the only reason for the decision.\\n\\n\\\"The packaging is much lighter,\\\" he said. \\\"Also, the performance standpoint is right for the customers in the compact SUV category.\\\"\\n\\nGallery: Kia EV3 2024\\n\\n40\\n\\nCost is surely another reason, and Kia could probably save on wiring and having to run less of it to the rear of the car, as well as simplifying some of the components. Another big cost-driven change brought to smaller E-GMP-based vehicles like the EV3 is the downgrade from 800 to 400 volts, which will allow Kia to use cheaper parts than what is required for the higher-voltage application.\\n\\nSwitching from front- to rear-wheel drive is much easier in an EV, and FWD still has its advantages. For instance, by not having a motor under the trunk floor, the cargo compartment can be deeper, allowing you to carry taller items and increasing the overall maximum possible load volume. Small crossover buyers are all about practicality and usability, and having a bigger trunk in the back is more important than having a smaller trunk and a bit of extra storage in the frunk.\\n\\nThe Kia EV3 offers the best of both worlds: a roomy 460-liter (16.2 cubic-feet) trunk with a false floor that reveals additional storage space and a small 25-liter (0.8 cu-ft) frunk that looks like it might even be a bit deeper than on other E-GMP cars. Kia puts a frunk in most of its electric vehicles, even the Niro EV, which is built on a combustion car platform, so the fact that the EV3 has one isn\\u2019t surprising.\\n\\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox.

The EV3 will have more understeer built into its suspension setup, and it probably won\\u2019t be quite as fun to drive, although the driving experience difference between front- and rear-wheel-drive EVs is not as obvious as in combustion vehicles.\\n\\nKia will offer dual-motor all-wheel, even a spicy EV3 GT, which will feel better to drive and provide a lot more performance. Having the second motor in the rear will limit the underfloor space in the trunk, but having more than double the power of the base model will more than make up for it.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"UPDATE: A Kia America spokesperson told InsideEVs that \\\"the bonus is only $7,500,\\\" which suggests customers cannot combine it with the $7,500 tax credit. We followed up asking if Kia Finance America is getting the $7,500 tax credit and passing it over to customers in the form of the EV lease bonus. \\\"Unfortunately, I cannot comment on behalf of Kia Finance,\\\" the spokesperson replied. Original story follows below.\\n\\nThe Kia EV6 is one of the most attractive models in its segment, but the fact it no longer qualifies for federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a turn off for many US buyers.\\n\\nKia America has decided to change that and offer a $7,500 EV lease bonus \\u2013 matching the maximum federal tax credit \\u2013 for the electric crossover on a lease of a new 2023 EV6.\\n\\nThe offer is valid from May 15 to July 5, with the $7,500 EV lease bonus applied as a capitalized cost reduction. For example, well-qualified lessees approved by Kia Finance can lease a 2023 Kia EV6 Wind RWD for $499 a month for 36 months with $4,999 due at lease inception.\\n\\nIn addition to the lease promotion, Kia Finance America is offering well-qualified buyers up to $3,750 in standard-rate finance bonus cash towards the purchase of a new 2023 Kia EV6.\\n\\n\\\"The Kia EV6 has been a home run, and this is an opportunity we think will appeal to many customers anxious to experience the EV lifestyle. With multiple available motor and drivetrain layouts and an EPA-estimated all-electric range of more than 300 miles in some variants, the EV6 offers something for everyone, and these special offers make it easier for customers to get behind the wheel of this exciting vehicle.\\\" Steven Center, COO & EVP, Kia America\\n\\n28\\n\\nInterestingly, Kia's press release does not include anything about the loophole that temporarily enables all new leased EVs to qualify for the maximum $7,500 federal tax credit. We've contacted Kia to learn if the $7,500 EV lease bonus for the EV6 is in addition to the tax credit and we'll update this story when we hear back.\\n\\nThe loophole enables leasing companies to receive tax credits for EVs even if the IRA vehicle and battery assembly requirements are not met, and the companies can choose to pass those savings onto customers.\\n\\nThe 2023 Kia EV6 is offered in three variants: Wind, GT-Line and GT. Wind and GT-Line are available in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive, while the range-topping GT only comes with all-wheel drive.\\n\\nBased on Hyundai Motor Group's E-GMP electric vehicle architecture, the EV6 is compatible with ultrafast 800V DC fast chargers, going from 10 to 80 percent state of charge in approximately 18 minutes on a 350-kW charger.\\n\\nThe electric crossover is EPA-rated at 310 miles of all-electric range (AER) on the GT-Line (RWD) and Wind (RWD) trims and offers available vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality.\\n\\nThe base Kia EV6 Wind RWD starts at $48,700, while the Wind AWD is priced from $52,600. The EV6 RWD GT-Line trim costs $52,900, while the GT-Line AWD starts at $57,600. The range-topping EV6 GT is priced from $61,600. All prices exclude a $1,325 destination fee.\\n\\nSource: Kia America\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 83,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Global EV sales grew by 35% in 2023 with 14.2 million BEVs and PHEVs sold, and Hyundai-Kia EV sales trended upward, contrasting with a decline in German EV sales due to reduced incentives.\",\n          \"Global EV sales grew by 55% in 2022 with 10.5 million BEVs and PHEVs delivered, although Hyundai-Kia's EV sales were not specifically mentioned.\",\n          \"The article reveals a leak of the Kia EV5, highlighting its design and specifications as the third electric vehicle based on Hyundai-Kia's E-GMP platform, set to be launched in the Chinese market with future global sales, reflecting the ongoing growth in the EV market.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_textblob\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          -1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_vader\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          -1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment_flair\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -1,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":71}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sentiment_columns = [\"sentiment_textblob\", \"sentiment_vader\", \"sentiment_flair\"]\n","\n","df['majority_sentiment'] = df[sentiment_columns].apply(majority_vote, axis=1)"],"metadata":{"id":"oNZKRBOFM6IY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"_buwJ4CyS44y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733160572906,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":340,"user":{"displayName":"채형김","userId":"13447971630655102369"}},"outputId":"0d91ea35-de1a-41cd-de4d-ed515cc64abb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       date                                              title  \\\n","0   2023-02                           Global EV Sales for 2022   \n","1   2023-02  Hyundai USA Launches Evolve+ EV Subscription P...   \n","2   2023-03          Hyundai Kona N Electric May Be On The Way   \n","3   2023-03  Hyundai Surprised At The Success Of The Ioniq ...   \n","4   2023-03  Hyundai Finds Causes For Ioniq 5's 12V Battery...   \n","..      ...                                                ...   \n","78  2024-11  Hyundai Ioniq 9: A Three-Row EV With 335 Miles...   \n","79  2024-11  'It Would Just Be Dumb': Kia Exec On Plan To K...   \n","80  2024-11   GM And Hyundai EV Pickup Could Be In Development   \n","81  2024-11  Kia Eyes PHEVs With 60 Miles Of Electric Range...   \n","82  2024-12  The green transition of electric trucks and buses   \n","\n","                                              article  \\\n","0   Global EV sales continued strong.

The news was broken by one Ioniq 5 owner on his YouTube channel, The Ioniq Guy, who said in a recent video (embedded above) he was contacted by a Hyundai PR representative with an update from the engineering department.\\n\\nWe were able to verify the PR statement from his video with Hyundai for accuracy and learn some more, so here are the main takeaways. The automaker says the 12-volt battery drain has been caused by two different unrelated issues.\\n\\nHyundai Ioniq frunk plastic lid and 12-volt battery\\n\\nThe main one is \\\"overactive unauthorized Bluelink use by 3rd party apps that is waking up the car too often.\\\" Basically, unauthorized third-party Bluelink apps are requesting information too frequently from the Ioniq 5. Each time that happens it wakes up the vehicle, causing significant draw until it goes to sleep.\\n\\nWhile the drive battery has enough energy to recharge the 12-volt battery multiple times, the battery saving mode cannot keep up with hundreds of even thousands requests per day \\u2013 The Ioniq Guy says the PR rep told him some of the vehicles were seeing as many as 5,000 Bluelink requests per day.\\n\\nAccording to Hyundai, the 12-volt battery drain issue has been resolved since January 31 by limiting Bluelink server traffic to 20 transactions per day. In addition, certain problematic unauthorized apps were blocked by the server, although their name was not disclosed. Customers were also informed to change their Bluelink password.\\n\\nNow, while most vehicles are solved since January 31, Hyundai says some came back and required 12V battery replacement for failing to take charge after the battery was dead too many times or for too long before January 31.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe second cause that's not covered in the video but was communicated to InsideEVs is something Hyundai calls \\\"EV Light On with DTC P1A9096 ICCU related.\\\" To solve this issue, the Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU) and ICCU fuse have to be replaced.\\n\\nNow, some vehicles that only had the ICCU fuse replaced also incurred Diagnostic Trouble Code P1B77 (high voltage error in the battery pack) as a result of ICCU failure. DTC P1B77 cases required the Power Relay Assembly (PRA) in the EV battery to be replaced as well.\\n\\nHyundai also told InsideEVs that a rumor going around on forums lately about the ICCU campaign in Korea for coolant leak being possibly related and causing the above issue is false.\\n\\n\\\"Fact: Not related. The Korea issue pertained to an Inverter Coolant Low Warning light on, not an EV Light On issue. It only applied to vehicles before 4/23/21 Production. Above issues have not been specific to such mfg period.\\\"\\n\\nIf you own a Hyundai Ioniq 5 \\u2013 or a Kia EV6 or Genesis GV60 which are based on the same E-GMP architecture \\u2013 and encountered 12V battery drain issues please share your experience in the comments section.\\n\\nSource: Hyundai via The Ioniq Guy (YouTube)\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"All of the Hyundai Motor Group electric vehicles based on the E-GMP platform so far have been rear-wheel-drive vehicles with optional dual-motor all-wheel-drive. Now Kia is going front-wheel drive with its smaller EVs, like the EV3 and EV5, but in an age of modular skateboard EV platforms, it may not be obvious why.\\n\\nBefore we had EVs built on dedicated platforms, the rule was that cheap combustion cars were front-wheel drive, and power went to the back wheels only in more expensive models. Front-wheel-drive evolved as the industry standard in the 1970s and 1980s as cars got smaller and the layout provided lots of cost-savings and packaging benefits too; one bonus was that they tended to perform better in snow than RWD cars too.\\n\\nBut then smaller, more affordable EVs like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Tesla Model 3 brought RWD to a lower price point and made it available to many more people.\\n\\nGet Fully Charged All sub-EV6 models from Kia will be front-wheel-drive All the Hyundai-Kia group vehicles built on E-GMP so far have been rear-wheel-drive, but now Kia is going front-wheel drive with its smaller electric offerings starting with the EV5 and all models below it in the range.\\n\\nWhere you put the motor in an EV has a lot less impact on the packaging of the vehicle than it does in a combustion car. You don\\u2019t need a prop shaft to send power to the other side of the vehicle, and electric motors are considerably more compact than combustion engines. So even if you put the motor in the back, you will still have enough space for a decent-sized trunk.\\n\\nDuring a media briefing event about the EV3, Kia's Head of Global Business Planning, Spencer Cho, explained that in this compact crossover class it's about giving the customer what they're most used to.\\n\\n\\\"This will be the front-wheel-drive models, which are targeted for... the affordable EVs the customers are looking for,\\\" Cho said. He said the EV3 is initially meant as less of a \\\"performance\\\" vehicle than the EV6 or even EV9. \\\"EV3 is targeting the mainstream EV buyers, so that's why we have chosen E-GMP with front-wheel-drive, which is much lighter.\\\"\\n\\nCho didn\\u2019t go into detail about how the weight savings were achieved, but he gave this as the only reason for the decision.\\n\\n\\\"The packaging is much lighter,\\\" he said. \\\"Also, the performance standpoint is right for the customers in the compact SUV category.\\\"\\n\\nGallery: Kia EV3 2024\\n\\n40\\n\\nCost is surely another reason, and Kia could probably save on wiring and having to run less of it to the rear of the car, as well as simplifying some of the components. Another big cost-driven change brought to smaller E-GMP-based vehicles like the EV3 is the downgrade from 800 to 400 volts, which will allow Kia to use cheaper parts than what is required for the higher-voltage application.\\n\\nSwitching from front- to rear-wheel drive is much easier in an EV, and FWD still has its advantages. For instance, by not having a motor under the trunk floor, the cargo compartment can be deeper, allowing you to carry taller items and increasing the overall maximum possible load volume. Small crossover buyers are all about practicality and usability, and having a bigger trunk in the back is more important than having a smaller trunk and a bit of extra storage in the frunk.\\n\\nThe Kia EV3 offers the best of both worlds: a roomy 460-liter (16.2 cubic-feet) trunk with a false floor that reveals additional storage space and a small 25-liter (0.8 cu-ft) frunk that looks like it might even be a bit deeper than on other E-GMP cars. Kia puts a frunk in most of its electric vehicles, even the Niro EV, which is built on a combustion car platform, so the fact that the EV3 has one isn\\u2019t surprising.\\n\\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox.

The EV3 will have more understeer built into its suspension setup, and it probably won\\u2019t be quite as fun to drive, although the driving experience difference between front- and rear-wheel-drive EVs is not as obvious as in combustion vehicles.\\n\\nKia will offer dual-motor all-wheel, even a spicy EV3 GT, which will feel better to drive and provide a lot more performance. Having the second motor in the rear will limit the underfloor space in the trunk, but having more than double the power of the base model will more than make up for it.\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\",\n          \"UPDATE: A Kia America spokesperson told InsideEVs that \\\"the bonus is only $7,500,\\\" which suggests customers cannot combine it with the $7,500 tax credit. We followed up asking if Kia Finance America is getting the $7,500 tax credit and passing it over to customers in the form of the EV lease bonus. \\\"Unfortunately, I cannot comment on behalf of Kia Finance,\\\" the spokesperson replied. Original story follows below.\\n\\nThe Kia EV6 is one of the most attractive models in its segment, but the fact it no longer qualifies for federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a turn off for many US buyers.\\n\\nKia America has decided to change that and offer a $7,500 EV lease bonus \\u2013 matching the maximum federal tax credit \\u2013 for the electric crossover on a lease of a new 2023 EV6.\\n\\nThe offer is valid from May 15 to July 5, with the $7,500 EV lease bonus applied as a capitalized cost reduction. For example, well-qualified lessees approved by Kia Finance can lease a 2023 Kia EV6 Wind RWD for $499 a month for 36 months with $4,999 due at lease inception.\\n\\nIn addition to the lease promotion, Kia Finance America is offering well-qualified buyers up to $3,750 in standard-rate finance bonus cash towards the purchase of a new 2023 Kia EV6.\\n\\n\\\"The Kia EV6 has been a home run, and this is an opportunity we think will appeal to many customers anxious to experience the EV lifestyle. With multiple available motor and drivetrain layouts and an EPA-estimated all-electric range of more than 300 miles in some variants, the EV6 offers something for everyone, and these special offers make it easier for customers to get behind the wheel of this exciting vehicle.\\\" Steven Center, COO & EVP, Kia America\\n\\n28\\n\\nInterestingly, Kia's press release does not include anything about the loophole that temporarily enables all new leased EVs to qualify for the maximum $7,500 federal tax credit. We've contacted Kia to learn if the $7,500 EV lease bonus for the EV6 is in addition to the tax credit and we'll update this story when we hear back.\\n\\nThe loophole enables leasing companies to receive tax credits for EVs even if the IRA vehicle and battery assembly requirements are not met, and the companies can choose to pass those savings onto customers.\\n\\nThe 2023 Kia EV6 is offered in three variants: Wind, GT-Line and GT. Wind and GT-Line are available in rear-wheel and all-wheel drive, while the range-topping GT only comes with all-wheel drive.\\n\\nBased on Hyundai Motor Group's E-GMP electric vehicle architecture, the EV6 is compatible with ultrafast 800V DC fast chargers, going from 10 to 80 percent state of charge in approximately 18 minutes on a 350-kW charger.\\n\\nThe electric crossover is EPA-rated at 310 miles of all-electric range (AER) on the GT-Line (RWD) and Wind (RWD) trims and offers available vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality.\\n\\nThe base Kia EV6 Wind RWD starts at $48,700, while the Wind AWD is priced from $52,600. The EV6 RWD GT-Line trim costs $52,900, while the GT-Line AWD starts at $57,600. The range-topping EV6 GT is priced from $61,600. All prices exclude a $1,325 destination fee.\\n\\nSource: Kia America\\n\\nShare this Story Facebook\\n\\nX\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nFlipboard\\n\\nReddit\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\nE-Mail\"\n        ],\n
